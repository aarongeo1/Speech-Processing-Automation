Execution
 To execute the program, run the python script titled CodeRunner.py which is located in the src directory. 
 CodeRunner.py will run clean.py first then transform.py which are also located in the same directory.
 Two standard libraries namely 'os' and 're' were imported to run these scripts.
 The cleaned data can be found under /root/clean and the transformed data is within /root/transformed.
