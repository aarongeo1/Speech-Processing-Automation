** Bias & Limitations **

One significant limitation of the transformation process is the reliance on a 
pre-defined dictionary of words and their corresponding ArpaBET phonetic representations.
If a word from the input text is not found in the dictionary, it will be omitted from 
the transformed data. This limitation can lead to a loss of information, particularly 
for domain-specific jargon, proper nouns, or newly coined words that may not be present 
in the dictionary. In such cases, the output may not accurately reflect the original 
text's phonetic content. The benefit of this approach is that it ensures only words with
known phonetic representations are included in the output. Users can have confidence 
that the phonetic transcriptions provided are based on established pronunciation 
information, reducing the risk of inaccuracies or misrepresentations.

Another potential source of bias is the handling of words with multiple pronunciations.
In the transformation process, when a word is found in the dictionary with multiple 
pronunciations, the choice is made to use only the first phonetic translation of the 
word. This decision is beneficial for several reasons. First, Using the first 
pronunciation for words with multiple entries in the dictionary promotes consistency
in the transformed data. This consistency simplifies the output, making it more 
predictable and easier to work with, especially in computational applications. Secondly,
By selecting a single pronunciation, the transformation process reduces ambiguity. 
When dealing with multiple pronunciations, especially ones related to different inflection
points, it can be challenging to decide which pronunciation to use. Choosing the first 
one simplifies this decision-making process. Lastly,  In many cases, the first listed 
pronunciation in a dictionary is the most common or widely accepted pronunciation of a 
word. This choice aligns with the principle of providing a standard representation that 
is more likely to match the way most people pronounce the word. It ensures that the 
transformed text remains intelligible to a broad audience.

The biases related to handling not-in-dictionary words and multiple pronunciations can 
drastically impact the transformation process when applied to different contexts such as
news programs. In the context of child-adult dyads, conversations can often include novel
vocabulary and creative words not present in standard dictionaries. Handling words not in 
the dictionary and omitting them can lead to a loss of child-specific language phonetics.
On the other hand, news programs typically involve more formal language where vocabulary
tends to align with established dictionaries. Therefore the likelihood of encountering
non-dictionary words are relatively low. With the Multiple pronunciation bias, when 
children learn a new language, it may introduce multiple variations in pronunciation for 
a single word. The bias of using the first pronunciation can simply the transformed data
but may not capture these variations accurately. Whereas news programs typically adhere to
standardized pronunciation. The key takeaway is that the choice of biases should be
tailored to the specific context in which the transformation is applied. Contextual 
understanding is essential for achieving meaningful and accurate results.
