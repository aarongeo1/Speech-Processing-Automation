	hideed  hid 
	he hided 	that's right 
	he jumped right outof the carriage and went to hide  behind the tree 
	and what did the little girl who's being the mommy say

	 you can't do that 
	 where are you 
	 where's my baby  laughs 
	 where's my baby 
	and she went running along to find her baby 
	where is her baby 
	the cat that's being the baby 
	yeah 
	behind her 
	she doesn't see him she ran right past 
	yeah 
	and here's some other kids 
	all the kids in this neighborhood like to pretend to be people  that they aren't 
	here's somebody pretending to be a 
	policeman 
	a policeman 
	and here's another kid on a tricycle 
	and he doesn't have much of a costume on  but he is wearing cowboy boots 
	so he's probably pretending to be a cowboy 
	she went running  saying 
	 help  help 
	 my baby ran away 
	and what did the policeman do 
	he saw it 
	he saw the baby 
	he said 
	 there's your baby 
	 there's your baby 
	what did the cat do 
	I don't know 
	the cat said 
	 -uh oh 
	 they found me 
	okay  let's turn the page 
	okay  so what did they say to the cat 
	I don't know 
	look at the policeman 
	what's the policeman doing 
	what's that called 
	I don't know 
	what does Michael the policeman do with his finger 
	beckoning

	  coughs  snivels 
	you've got a cough  huh 
	he's saying 
	 come here kitty  kitty  kitty 
	and they go to chase the cat  and the little girl 
	look at that  laughs 
	was standing on the policeman's coat  so the policeman fell down 
	and off goes the cat and the boy who's pretending to be the cowboy is laughing 
	okay  and they go to chase the cat he says 
	 you're not going to get me here 
	and the cat goes into a great big pipe on the ground 
	and the cat is looking out the end of the pipe 
	and all the kids are crawling through 
	you think they're going to make it through 
	or do you think they're going to get stuck in the middle 
	I don't know 
	I don't know either 
	let's turn the page and find out what happens 
	well  out they come  right into a  mud puddle 
	did he fall in a mud puddle 
	uhhuh 
	yeah 
	and here's the little girl 
	and she says 
	 you silly policeman  the cat's going that way  and there you were down in the mud puddle 
	so he helps the little girl out 
	-uh oh 
	they both fall into the mud puddle 
	and the kitty goes and says 
	 what's going on now 
	everybody's in the mud puddle  and what did the kitty do 
	went in 
	ran right back in the pipe 
	is there somebody else in that pipe 
	-um  the cowboy 
	the cowboy's still there  I think 
	yeah 
	so  the little girl who's being the mommy and the kid who's being the policeman crawl back in after the cat 
	and they come out the other direction 
	and  meanwhile  the little boy who was the cowboy caught the cat 
	and here comes the kids through the pipe 
	oh no 
	what 
	oh no 
	what did he do 
	what did the cowboy do 
	he dropped that kitty right on the policeman's  head 
	and now the policeman has a  a cat hat  instead of a policeman hat 
	and the kitty runs away again 
	and he goes up a tree 
	this is quite an adventure 
	and the policeman climbs the tree to get the kitty 
	and he finally gets the cat
