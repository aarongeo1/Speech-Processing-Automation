	it was too big for him  
	what kind of shirt is that guy using  wearing  
	Batman shirt  
	Batman shirt  
	just like the one you're gonna get  
	now  
	okay  
	so

	no  
	it is not really nice to hit animals  
	people don't do that  
	only mean people who do that  
	so  
	here's the kitty  
	and he's walking to a  into a great big  what  
	drain pipe  
	right  
	so  
	they all go through the pipe  
	and here is the kitty  watching them from the other end  
	and they're all going to go through the pipe to try and get that kitty  
	and assoonas they get out what happens  
	xxx  
	he fell into the little water  
	see  
	any the kitty just ran up the hill  
	cause kittys are better climbers than people  
	aren't they  
	would you like to fall in water like that right on your nose

	that kitty thinks it's awfully funny that they're falling in the water  
	huh  
	okay  
	why do you think that kitty has whiskers coming outof his top of his head  
	huh  
	well  
	it looks kinda  kind of strange  
	-uh oh  
	they all splash in the water  
	and there the kitty goes running through the pipe again  
	and they are so angry this little boy and girl  who are dressed up like a lady and a policeman  
	I think they're really determined to get the cat now  
	but who got him  
	who got the cat  
	the boy  
	the little boy  
	right  
	the one that was wearing the Batman shirt  
	he caught the cat  
	oh  
	and look the cat is  is on top of that little boy's head  
	does he look very happy  
	hunhunh  
	oh  
	I think he's scratching him  
	he must hurt him  
	huh

	doesn't it  
	when they go  noise can you show me how it feels  
	oh  
	yeah  
	that is how it feels  
	so  
	this little girl is very angry at the little boy  for letting the cat go on top of the policeman boy's head  
	and she's bawling him out  
	you know how you can tell she's bawling him out  
	how  
	she's holding onto his ear and going  noises can you do that with your hand  
	go  noise  
	you don't know how  
	hm  
	okay  
	they the cat starts running up the tree  
	do you think the cat's gonna escape  
	yep a  
	yep a  
	think so  
	lookit  
	I can even see the scratch marks on the little policeman  
	oh no  
	they all  
	he climbed up the tree to try to get the cat  
	the cat's hanging on that little limb  
	you think the limb's gonna break  
	hm  
	you tell me  
	what happened  
	the kitty cat  
	he got the kitty  
	that's right  
	and what's this boy doing here  
	something not very nice  
	he's sticking his tongue out  
	to the policeman  
	no  
	that's just a little boy  
	that's not really a policeman  Davey  
	it's just a little boy dressed up as a policeman  
	she the great big funny shoes and the big  blue shirt  
	that's not really a policeman  
	he just has a police outfit on  
	okay  
	anyway  
	the police boy got the cat  
	and the lady  the little girl that's dressed like a lady is so happy  
	and the little boy that's got the Batman shirt on is very angry  
	and so he stuck his tongue out  
	and then  what happened  
	the cat fell

	that's what could happen when you go climbing on trees and d don't go on strong l  limbs  the branch breaks and goes  
	 crash  
	and the cat fell  
	and the little girl caught him  and the policeman fell and landed right on the little boy with the Batman shirt  
	and they're all just so battered and tired and dirty  
	and here they go walking home  
	except this time the kitty is following  
	behind and the little boy with the Batman shirt is riding in the carriage  
	they are so tired and so scratched up  
	and the little girl is going into her house  
	and what's she bringing them  
	what's she got on that tray  
	doctor stuff  
	well  
	she's dressed as a nurse
