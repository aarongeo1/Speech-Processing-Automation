	do you know what Happy is  
	can you tell by what he's wearing what he might be  
	a hat  
	he's wearing a hat  
	he looks like somebody in one of the books that we have at home

	remember  
	Peter Policeman  
	well  we can call him Happy the Policeman what is he blowing  
	a whistle

	maybe that's why the policeman was named Happy  cause he helps people find things  
	okay  so they went over to Puddy  
	and what did they say  
	wh she yelled  
	what did she yell  
	to kitty cat  
	what did she yell to the kitty cat
