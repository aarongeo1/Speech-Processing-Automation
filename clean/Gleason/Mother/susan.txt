	okay her name is  -um Mathilda 
	yeah 
	and Mathilda had a little pussy cat 
	that she played with and she would pretend that her pussy cat was her baby 
	well one day she stopped and she saw some lovely flowers 
	she went to pick it and her pussy cat didn't like pretending it was a baby so it jumped outof the baby carriage 
	when Mathilda turned around  her baby was gone 
	and she said 
	 oh dear 
	 where has my baby gone 
	and there's her baby 
	here's the pussy cat right behind a tree 
	but Mathilda doesn't know that 
	and so she goes running down the street 
	 help 
	 help 
	and there she sees her friend Charlie pretending he's a policeman 
	and Charlie stops all the traffic and says  
	 I'm a policeman 
	 I can help you 
	and xxx she says  
	 my baby 
	 he's gone 
	 my pussy cat 
	she jumped outof the  baby carriage 
	and Charlie says 
	 she's right behind you 
	 there she is 
	 see 
	I told you I could help you find her 
	and you can see Mathilda's very  very happy 
	now they hafta get the pussy cat back 
	and Charlie sets down low and tries to creep along  to get the -um pussy cat 
	the pussy cat 
	what kind 
	look at that face  what do you think the pussy cat's saying 
	you tell me 
	you want me to tell you 
	he's saying  
	 I don't wanna go back into that baby carriage 
	sure enough  just as Charlie reaches out to get the pussy cat  the pussy cat runs away 
	and Mathilda is very upset and says  
	 you get my pussy cat for me 
	ah notice that this little fella here 
	we'll hafta give him a name 
	do you know his name 
	no 
	we have Charlie 
	should we name him  Craig 
	yeah 
	okay that's Craig 
	Craig thinks this is all very funny and first he's getting  kinda  kind of bored 
	when Charlie was gonna try and get the pussy cat and the pussy cat runs away he thinks  it's pretty funny 
	yeah but  
	well yeah but I will fix this little cover 
	is it coming off a little bit 
	yeah 
	okay 
	oh  oh there's his whistle 
	  gasp yes he's got a policeman's whistle so there is Charlie and Mathilda tip  oh tiptoeing along 
	  sneezes I'm  I'm  I'm gonna blow my nose 
	I know how 
	okay 
	it doesn't have a spider in it 
	no there's no spider in it  I think we would get a little bit more out if you blow hard 
	  blows nose 
	ah that's good 
	no  no  no  no 
	does it hurt 
	no 
	okay now the pussy cat begins to go into a big tunnel here 
	and here comes Mathilda and Charlie following 
	and Craig's just  following along  to see what happens 
	there  laughs goes Charlie 
	he jogs into the tunnel too to following the pussy cat 
	and see 
	this tunnel goes through a big mound of the dirt 
	and there's the pussycat standing on top of the tunnel 
	he's gone out 
	he's walled  crawled through and climbed up on top 
	and at the other end of the tunnel is a puddle of water 
	I guess it's more than a puddle 
	it must be a river 
	hm I wonder what happens next 
	they all go in the tunnel 
	poor Charlie falls in and gets wet 
	and there's Mathilda saying  
	 there goes my pussy cat 
	 hurry up and get her 
	then here  Charlie's very surprised when he falls out 
	here I think he's getting angry  with Mathilda 
	yeah 
	cause he's  trying his best and she's yelling at him saying 
	 there goes my pussycat 
	 you go get him 
	hm he  laughing tries to help Mathilda out and what happens 
	look what happens 
	she falls on top of him 
	the pussy cat thinks this is pretty funny 
	there  laughing they all are 
	they're sopping wet in the water 
	and the pussy cat  jumps back into the tunnel 
	so now what happens but Mathilda and Charlie hafta go back through  the tunnel 
	and lookit here 
	here is Craig sitting on the top and he catches the pussy cat 
	hah and the pussy cat who really doesn't wanna be caught  jumps on top of Charlie's head 
	and Charlie's saying  
	 get off of my head 
	 get off of my head 
	and Mathilda  is saying something here to Craig 
	she's saying  
	 you hafta be gentle with my pussy cat 
	the pussy cat gets off of Charlie's face and starts running up  the tree 
	this pussy cat is really trying very hard not to get caught 
	he climbs up the tree and he jumps over to this branch 
	now he doesn't have any place to go so Charlie reaches over and gets a hold of the cat and picks up the cat by the back of his neck 
	and that doesn't bother the pussy cat 
	cats don't mind being picked up that way 
	ouch 
	oh I'm sorry 
	-um and here's Mathilda ever so happy  that Charlie got the cat 
	but Craig isn't so ha  happy any more cause he thought he was going to be able to get it 
	just then what happens 
	lookit there 
	the branch begins to break and Charlie drops the pussycat right into the arms of Mathilda 
	now Mathilda has the pussy cat 
	but poor Charlie has landed right on top of Craig 
	ah  laughs and look who ends up in the  baby carriage 
	not the pussy cat  but Craig because poor Charlie landed on top of Craig  and look at poor Charlie 
	he's got scratches on his face and he's got this stick here that he hasta use as his cane 
	now Mathilda says  
	 now you fellas you wait right out here 
	 I'll be back in a moment 
	and here she is 
	now she's pretending she's the nurse  she brings out some  lemonade and cookies and glasses to drink 
	and she's going to make them better  huh 
	because here's Charlie who's got scratches on his face  and bruises from falling outof the tree 
	and so he needs  something to make him feel better
