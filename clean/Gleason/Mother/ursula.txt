	who 
	who get  likes to get dressed up

	I cann't imagine 
	somebody named Ursula Ann 
	me 
	laughs she's giving her kitty cat a little ride in the carriage  huh 
	yeah 
	oh oh  gasp 
	look what happened 
	she's bending over to pick a very pretty flower  and  the cat doesn't like the ride 
	cats don't usually like to ride too well so  he's trying to run outof the carriage when she's not looking 
	she turns around and she goes 
	 oh no 
	she sees the blanket on the ground and the cat's gone 
	course he knows where she is  he's peeking at her from behind the tree 
	she runs off to get a policeman because she cann't find her cat 
	she's really kind of worried 
	and she finds a policeman 
	and  
	what she say 
	there's a little body  she oh 
	I don't know  she probably says 
	 oh dear  oh dear  my cat has run away  and I cann't find him 
	the policeman  puts up his hand 
	see he's saying 
	 stop 
	oop 
	they turn around and there's the cat  sitting right there looking at them 
	they probably feel kinda  kind of foolish now  cause they thought he was missing and he wasn't at all 
	so they say  
	 here kitty  kitty  kitty 
	but that   
	kitty  kitty 
	cat doesn't wanna be caught  you know 
	they don't like to be 
	he's looking at them asif to say 
	 well you catch me if you can 
	and there   
	was he   
	whoop 
	the policeman tries to reach him and he cann't 
	he falls over 
	the little boy's laughing 
	and the little girl's very angry 
	she's kinda  kind of disgusted with him that he cann't  couldn't catch the cat 
	so they're still calling him  and they're walking  after the cat to try to catch him 
	an the cat's looking back at them 
	he's gonna go through this big pipe 
	and he's probably gonna hide on them 
	I would imagine 
	oh no 
	look at this 
	he crawled into there and he's gonna make all of them crawl through there to catch him 
	look at him 
	he's peeking  in to see where they are 
	oh isn't that funny 
	what 
	  chuckles look at the man 
	well it's really a boy dressed up 
	but  he's gonna fall onto the end an there's water down there 
	they're not gonna like that too well 
	he falls in the water  and he helps the little girl out 
	the cat in the meantime is watching 
	he's probably having a real ball watching them fall in 
	oh no  look at that  he fell right in the h  in head first into the water 
	now   
	oop  
	now there he goes back in the pipe again  laughs 
	oh they're so mad now 
	oh no  that was clever 
	see the little boy 
	he was sitting at the other end waiting  and he got the kitty when he came out  gasp 
	he lost him 
	there he is hopping on that little boy's head 
	oh they must be furious with that cat  huh 
	now he's gonna climb the tree 
	now they're gonna have a great time getting him outof the tree 
	he climbs up the tree 
	laughs 
	the kitty cat's hanging on by one limb  grabs a hold of him 
	  giggles 
	whoops there goes the branch 
	it's ready to crack 
	oh oh 
	there it goes snap 
	he's fallen down 
	laughs 
	you think that's funny 
	laughs what happened  
	xxx  the man 
	well the branch wasn't strong enough to hold him  so he's gonna fall 
	xxx 
	thud  right on the ground 
	well  they're all kinda  kind of battered and bruised and they're tired of trying to find that cat 
	there he 
	look at him 
	he's walking along behind just as  like nothing happened 
	proud as can be  
	is  is he a baby 
	no  I think he's kinda  kind of tired out so they put him in the carriage  I guess 
	I know he's awfully tired 
	look at him 
	he ca  he's sitting down resting 
	and the little girl 
	I dunno  don't know what she's up to 
	oh she says
