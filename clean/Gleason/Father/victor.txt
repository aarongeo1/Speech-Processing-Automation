	one day when  when  when mama xxx went inside and read dat  that book  
	she did read it  
	yeah  
	oh  gee  I never heard this story before  
	but here's a woman  pushing  a  a carriage  
	a baby carriage with a cat in it  
	what a silly thing to do  
	oh  maybe it's a little girl dressed up to be a mama  
	think so  
	yeah  
	I think so too  
	well she went to pick a flower right here  
	one of these pretty red flowers  
	yeah  
	and the cat jumped out  
	oh oh  
	she put her hands up and said   
	 oh oh  
	 where's my cat  
	he was hiding behind this tree  
	she couldn't find him  
	she was really upset because  he jumped away  and she couldn't find him  and she didn't know where he was  
	there he is  
	there he is hiding  
	she didn't know it  
	well  she st  she  started to look for the cat  
	she didn't see it  
	but she saw a policeman so she thought she'd ask for some help  
	help	 my cat is lost  
	you see the policeman  
	yeah  
	hmm  
	well  the policeman said  
	 there's you cat lady right over there  
	oh there he is she said  
	 I'll just go get him  
	and the policeman went to get the cat but the cat  ran away  
	and now  
	you know how we sometimes go to pat the cats and they run away  
	yeah  
	well  but she wanted her cat back  
	so they started to chase the cat  
	he ran and they ran after him  
	then he ran into this  pipe  
	like a big tunnel  
	so the policemen crawled into the pipe  
	the cat was already at the other side  
	and then when the policeman came out  the cat ran up the hill  
	oh  and then the policeman helped the  the lady get outof the pipe  
	and they fell down  
	ohmygoodness  
	they're pretty clumsy  aren't they  laughs

	ohmygoodness  
	then they  ran into the pipe and crawled through  
	oh  look at that  
	the little boy caught the cat  
	well  the cat jumped right up on the policeman  
	and  and jumped on his head  
	and then ran up a tree  
	he's a pretty hard cat to  catch  isn't he  
	and now the  the  cat is up in the tree  
	oh   look at them pointing  
	and the policeman climbed up the tree  trying to catch the cat  
	which he did  
	he caught him right there  
	and now what's gonna happen  
	I don't  
	oh oh  
	the policeman is falling and the cat is falling  
	well  the cat fell into the lady's arms  
	and the policeman fell right on his head  laughs  
	what happened here  
	nothing nothing  
	nothing  
	nothing  
	oh  now the child is in the baby carriage  
	and the cat is walking right with them  
	oh  look what happened  
	what  
	the lady went into the house  
	and she changed her clothes and when she came out   it turns out that she was a nurse  
	now she's gonna fix up the policeman because he really got hurt when he fell outof that tree
