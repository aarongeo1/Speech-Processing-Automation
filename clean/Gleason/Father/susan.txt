	I'm gonna  I'm gonna  going  I'm sit in this chair  
	okay  
	it's so  so heavy  
	carry it over for me  
	be glad to  
	maybe you can slide it  
	see if it'll  see if it'll slide  
	push  
	that's it  
	yep  
	turn it around  
	that's like the camera we have at home  whistles  
	this is a story called   
	 Thegreatcatchase  
	oh  
	it's a Mercer Mayer  book  
	she's the one who wrote the story you have about the  the uh monsters  
	you remember  
	with the  uh with the Gololopus  
	yeah  
	and the uh letter eating   the letter eating  
	I can't remember what it was  
	it was a letter eating something  
	yeah  
	remember that one  
	yeah  
	well there is a lady  taking her  dog for a walk  
	no  
	her cat  
	oh  
	excuse me  
	yes  
	her cat  
	she's taking her cat for a walk in a little carriage there  
	tsk  
	and -uh she looks -uh  kinda  kind of bundled up  doesn't she  that pussy cat  
	yeah  
	are you comfortable  
	she stops  to uh  pick up her roller skates  
	actually  she's picking a flower  
	and look what the cat does  
	the cat jumps outof the carriage  
	and she runs around and hides  behind this tree  
	and the lady is very  very upset  
	oh  dear  she says  
	 oh dear   
	wh   
	 where is that cat  
	she's so excited she throws her arms up in the air  
	and the flower goes  a scooting off through the air  
	she's feeling very upset  
	why  
	because her pussy cat  
	she's probably  
	maybe she calls it a baby just like you do  
	her  her  her baby  her pussy cat is gone  
	she doesn't know where she is  
	I think that she's a little girl just like you and that she  clears throat is taking  pretending she's taking her baby for a walk  
	and she's using her pussy cat for the baby  
	oh  
	tsk  
	so then she runs down the street and there's a little guy dressed up as a policeman  
	and she says   
	 oh  
	 oh  
	 oh  
	 my baby's gone  
	 I don't know what's happened  
	 maybe somebody kidnapped him  
	 he's gone from the carriage  
	the policeman's there holding up traffic  
	clothes don't fit  do they  
	do they  
	no   
	no xxx  laughing  
	I think he's probably her little brother or somebody else in the neighborhood pretending to be a policeman  gasps  
	and what's the policeman do  
	oh  
	he s  he sees the cat  
	mm  
	mm  
	yeah  
	what do you think he's saying to the lady  
	what  
	what do you think  
	what do you think he says to her  
	you s  you tell me  
	he says   
	 oh  
	 oh  
	 there  there she is  
	 there's your baby  
	 there's your pussy cat  
	and the lady says   
	 oh  
	 I'm sorry

	what  
	the policeman goes down on his knees  
	and he says   
	 here kitty  kitty  kitty  kitty  here kitty  kitty  kitty  
	and he's trying to get the kitty to come over  
	and what happens

	he falls over  
	look at her face  
	how does she look  
	you tell me  
	pardon

	she's saying   
	 look what you did  
	 you scared away my pussy cat  
	 you go get him  
	tsk  
	so there they are  following after the pussy cat  
	look at that look on the pussy cat's face  
	what  
	how does he feel  
	how does he feel  
	I think he's saying to himself   
	 I'm going to outfox them  
	hmm

	and he's going  he's going in that pipe to hide  
	hmm  
	he thinks it's a good place  
	oh  
	I reckon  
	why  
	maybe he thinks they can't follow him in there  
	why  
	tsk  
	why  
	perhaps  perhaps he  he thinks the pipe is too small for them to get in  
	you think they'll be able to follow him in there  
	you do  
	well  we'll see  
	oh there they are  trying to crawl in after the pussycat  
	and look what's happened on the other side  
	what  
	the pussycat has come out  and is sitting on top of the pipe  
	oh  
	looking back in to see if they're gonna follow him through  
	out he comes  
	and there's the pussycat up there  
	look at that expression on the pussy's face  
	how do you think the pussy feels  
	you tell me
