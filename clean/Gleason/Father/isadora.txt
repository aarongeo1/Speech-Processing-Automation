	I don't think that's a lady  
	I think that's a little girl dressed up like a mommy  
	doesn't that look like a little girl  
	so  
	the little girl's playing with her cat pretending her cat is a doll  
	an she walks along  
	and she's gonna pick some flowers  
	does that look like a dandelion

	she didn't see what happened  
	then she turned around and looked inside

	he's got a little badge

	the mommy is looking at what the policeman's doing  gasp  
	look  
	the pipe goes through a little tiny hill and out the other side  
	the cat's already out  
	and  
	he's poking his head down  
	and  
	he looks at the policeman at the other side of the pipe  
	xxx that funny

	kaplunk	and  
	the mommy comes throught  throughout the pipe  
	but  
	before she falls coming outof it  she sees the cat  
	  giggles  
	look at that cat's face now  
	he's still trying to run away  
	and  
	the policeman isn't very happy  
	and  
	the girl isn't very happy  
	so  
	the policeman helps the little girl down outof the pipe  
	she's about to step on her  pearls  
	look at  that  
	yeah   
	she's gonna step on those pearls  
	so  
	the policeman's helping her down  
	and uh oh  
	she falls  
	boom  
	right on the policeman and knocks him over again  
	and  
	his hat falls off  
	and  
	her hat falls off  
	and  
	look  
	the cat's coming back  
	the cat's coming back down to see what's happened

	and  
	they're gonna chase the cat again  
	and  
	they chase him throught  throughout the pipe  
	first the little girl goes in  
	and  
	now the little boy goes in  
	and  
	then look  
	they get to the other end of the pipe  
	and  
	the second little boy has caught the cat  
	and  
	he's about to give it back to them  
	but the cat  jumps up on the policeman's head  
	and  
	look at that  
	and  
	he's scratching at him  and pawing at him  and tickling him  
	just like that  
	and  
	he's climbing all over him  
	and  
	the little policeman can't do anything about it  
	that's what happened  
	and  
	the mommy is angry at the little boy  
	she's pulling his ear  
	I don't know why that's xxx  gasp  
	because the little boy put the cat on the policeman's head  
	that was a silly thing to do
