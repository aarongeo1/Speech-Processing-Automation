	and I think this police has fallen flat on his nose trying to catch that cat  
	kalunk	and then  they're going along in the woods  
	and suddenly  
	what  
	the cat goes into a big pipe  to hide  
	and then  
	what  
	-uh oh  
	I see trouble  
	cause you see what's happening here  
	hm  
	all these guys  the policeman and the lady are going in this end of the tunnel  
	and if it comes out the other end then they're going to fall into the water  
	and the cat's sitting up here and the cat's going to laugh  
	and  and  and he's sitting up there  
	ah that's right  
	he's Batman  
	and I think it's going to turn out that he knows better than the rest of them how to do this  
	what do you think  
	yeah  
	do you think he's going to be the hero of this story  
	yeah  
	-uh oh  laughs what happened here  hm  
	can you tell me what happened  
	he's going into the water  
	that's right  
	he fell into the water  
	splush	and there goes that old cat  laughs  
	you see he's trying to help her outof the pipe  
	and she falls down and kaplunk	what a mess  
	and now they're really getting wet  
	and the cat is jumping back in the pipe and going right back where they came from  
	and what are these people saying  
	what  
	I don't know  
	what are they saying  
	I don't know  
	you don't know what they're saying  
	no  
	I think they're saying  
	 stop you pesky cat  
	 you're driving us crazy  
	 we're gonna catch you  
	so then  the lady and the policeman are putting their clothes back on  
	and they crawl into the pipe  
	and look at the other end  
	who turned out to have caught the cat  
	the boy  
	the boy  
	that's because little boys often know how to do things better than big people  can't that right  
	hm  
	especially if they're Batman  
	oh  laughs  
	then he put the cat  right on the policeman's head and the lady is grabbing the little boy by the ear  
	and what do you think she's telling him  
	I don't know  
	I think she's saying something like -um   
	 that wasn't a very nice thing to do  
	but he after all caught the cat  
	so why should she complain  right  
	right  
	and then the cat is about to go up the tree  
	yeah  
	yeah and xxx  
	look he scratched the policeman's face off  
	and then  the policeman's trying to catch the cat  
	and here  he got him  
	what do you think the cat  
	do you think that cat looks happy  
	no he looks mad  
	he looks mad  
	the cat didn't wanna get caught  did he  
	I think the little boy likes the cat too  
	and the lady's sh  
	no  
	he's always mad  
	huh  
	-uh oh  
	-uh oh  
	what happened  
	he's falling down  
	he's falling down  
	crash  
	the whole tree broke I think

	where  
	and now the man's falling down outof the tree  
	yeah  
	oh and that poor

	the cat's alright  
	oh and here's the  here's the boy going home on the  in the baby buggy  
	and the policeman's limping home  
	and the cat's just following right along behind him  
	and then here's the lady  
	and she's telling them  something  
	I wonder what she's saying to them there
