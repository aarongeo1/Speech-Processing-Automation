	you know what he's gonna do now   
	he's gonna use the steps as the foundation  
	he wants to  
	he really wants it to be concrete back there is what it comes right down to  
	and he'd like to use the  the steps rather than take them down

	that's a  problem  
	so what's he gonna do about that  
	I don't know
