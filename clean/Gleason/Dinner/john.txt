	it was pretty hard to find a parking space near there  
	jammed up like anything  
	oi	Harold  would you help her a little bit  
	-um  
	what's a matter  
	there was long  long lines of people  
	when you finally got in you saw five  no five on each side ten like booths  
	little gray  like little teeny houses   
	very teeny  
	just big enough for one person  
	yeah  and they was all just for one person  
	they was what  
	and they was too little  
	they was too little  
	did they let you take her in   
	xxx   
	yeah  they was just big enough for one person  
	Rachi and I went in  
	and you push a  a lever like a little button on the side  
	something you push down  
	 I think to the right  
	and the curtains close behind you  so only you are inside  
	and nobody can see what you're voting  
	remember  
	and then you push down the little levers  
	like one says Carter	 Ford  
	and who are the candidates for Congress  
	Senate  
	Congress I think  
	Neelea  
	okay  
	and the other guy I forgot  
	but who's the candidate for this district   
	xxx   
	Nealea  
	one who's running for reelection  
	give me  
	congressman  
	the US Congress  
	oh  I don't remember   
	what if you vote xxx    
	xxx   
	what if you voted for both of them   
	was it O'Neil    
	I didn't even recognize    
	O'Neil  O'Neil  
	was it O'Neil  
	yeah  I was glad  
	I didn't even know we was in  
	I felt so xxx  
	I thought we was in Drinan's district  
	no  that's Brookline and Newton  
	-um  
	what did you say  John  
	I was probably taken off the    
	what if you voted for both of them   
	xxx   
	then at the very end    
	give me  give me apple juice  
	at the    
	okay  
	at the very end then you press  
	after you vote for all the people you want to vote  like one person for President  one person for senator  
	you vote for different things  
	you  then when you're all done you press that lever to the left  
	but if you press two for one thing like if you press two people for President it won't work  
	would you want to press the whole thing to finish voting  it won't work  
	it won't click  
	it'll be stuck  
	I think  
	well  
	is that right  
	unh  
	I love these mushrooms  
	so another words  -um  voting machines can't be void  
	only paper ballot can be void   
	Mommy  look  -um look  
	and that's what happened  
	got some  
	what  
	look  
	Donald Duck's xxx  
	yeah  here's Donald Duck   
	what if  what if you voted for both of them   
	then the  the machine wouldn't work  
	when you tried to press it off  on  at the very end of all your voting you hafta press one pin  to make the machine click  
	and that way your turn is finished  
	but if you voted for both of them     
	what is that called Ima  
	the voting machine  
	the polling place  
	no  what that I go in your box  
	oh  this  
	-uh  meat and rice  
	you want some more  
	yeh  
	I want some  too  
	okay  me  too  
	so  if you didn't click  
	if you voted for more than one  then at the very end when you go to press it down  it won't click

	and it won't click until you  change it  until you change it to vote for only one of them
