	one thousand dollars if we do the work  three thousand   
	I have xxx    
	if he does the work  
	Mommy   
	laughs   
	is this the one you like  
	no  
	Mommy  I wan you pour me some milk  
	he was just very quiet  
	I have a feeling    
	one thousand instead  of three hundred  
	we  y you had a three hundred bid  didn't you  
	yeah  right  
	I think Bob Higgens is gonna get our  
	did you laugh in his face  
	no  he     
	what did he say   
	no  he sent me it in the mail  laughs  
	mm  
	try this  
	it was very well written up though  
	xxx I'm sorry  
	have another one  
	  soft moan  
	did you describe anything to me about Norstrom  
	no  but he came in a suit  and a tie   
	very quiet  didn't say much of anything   
	well  who is the guy   who's the guy you liked the best  
	Sherman  
	and I haven't gotten  his yet  
	oh   
	but I imagine his is going to be comparable  
	hm  
	I just  have this feeling  
	I don't know  Bob Higgens seems to be more in our  price range  
	and what was his bid  
	three hundred and six hundred  
	yeah  
	think he's gonna get the job  laughs  
	what  laughs  
	think I'm going to get the job  
	no  
	you think he's gonna get the job  
	well  I mean  if Sherman comes up with a two thousand for him to do all the work  I think Bob Higgens is gonna get the job  yeah  laughs  
	maybe we can    
	I mean  that's one thousand five hundred dollars difference   
	yeah  we can just tell Higgens we want him to put up the new plaster board  
	yeah  well  I  I'm sure that will increase it  you know  somewhat  but  
	  clears throat how many total bids did you solicit  
	six  
	no ten  
	oh   
	ten  or eleven  
	how many total have you gotta date   
	Mommy  look  at all that tomato   
	Rand Sherman's my last one   
	Mommy  look at all that   
	huh   
	tomato sauce in my milk  
	mu  
	oh  yeah  
	know why  
	cause you got some on your mouth and then it  
	Sherman's the only one out  
	mhm  
	yep  
	Norstrom and Sherman came the same day  clears throat  
	Norstrom's    
	oughta   
	Norstrom is  
	oughta  get Sherman's tomorrow  
	Norstrom is high  
	he's the highest so far  
	there was another  
	yes  he is the highest so far because  Billy England  -uh  was my first one and he was the highest  
	for him to do just the preparation  cause I never asked him if he would do everything  
	his was only  
	his was  
	I mean like  maybe four hundred or five hundred  
	uhhuh  
	and that was the highest  for preparation but -um  
	is the rule of thumb  you know  you double whatever their preparation is and you get their paying cost  
	no  I don't know what the rule of thumb is because  I didn't ask them all that question  
	because it wasn't until I was half way through talking to these people that you decided that you decided that maybe it would be worth us asking them to do all the work   
	Mommy  would you    
	Mommy  would you help me get it back in  
	how many  -uh  people did you ask in all  
	the last four  
	now three of them have doubled it  
	Mommy  
	yeah  
	da  the last four  two doubled it  and one only gave me an estimate for when he did all the work  
	and you never gave anything back from that  called you  called up and you answered  
	mm  
	see  that's why it would've been nice if you'd taken me seriously when I first started talking  laughs  
	hm  
	otherwise I could've had twelve estimates  
	oh here now  
	it wasn't that I didn't take you seriously  
	  sighs  
	it's just that I just didn't  think at the time about how unrealistic it would be for you to try to do the painting yourself  
	that's cause I don't think that you got really into it  
	xxx more milk  
	that's true  
	I didn't get into it  
	I wish you'd gotten into it at the time when I started discussing it  
	I think I made too much here  
	we're not going to be eating all of this  
	how are you doing  Susan

	well  that's not a real flower  
	I know  
	so they can't  
	you're right  they can't  
	but in a real flower  from a real flower they could make honey  
	but what I mean  
	why can't they make honey in a pretend flower  
	because there's no nectar  in a pretend flower  
	only in real flowers  
	but why isn't there  
	why isn't there  
	well  cause that's just made outof  straw or something

	yes   
	and those are skunks  right  
	what are they doing  
	they're in the grass  
	mm   
	well   know an interesting thing is that bees don't fly at night time because they don't see and they come out to what the problem is and the skunks eat them  
	oh really  
	skunks eat bees  
	yep  
	they're very brave
