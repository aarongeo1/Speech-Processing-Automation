	you wanted to go back to the car  
	I see  
	he got a little nervous  
	mhm  
	it's a terrific place to go though cause they have alotof tide and so you can get in the canoe and it takes you right out  
	mm hm   
	but  it's not a canoe actually  it's a rowboat  
	mhm  
	it's not a canoe  it's not

	I see  
	I  I took  Sabina in my car  
	you did  
	did you drive her  
	there was also a mat too  
	wasn't there  Charlie  
	what kind  
	a mat is that thing you lie on in the water  
	it's not a boat  
	remember  
	it's a raft   
	it blows up   
	a raft  
	it looks sorta  sort of like a boat  
	remember  
	yes  
	well  
	I remember  
	well  that's  
	you used that  
	that was better for Charlie   
	well  
	the whole place was so good  
	cause there're all sorts of little  pools around you  
	yeah  
	but low tide was at one or something like that  right  
	I guess you're right   because there  when we gotta the beach there're incredible greenheads  everywhere  
	but by the time we gotta the beach there was -um  there was pools of water and leftover spaces and stuff like that and you could look for sand dollars that just washed up   
	mhm   
	mhm  
	Charlie didn't look for sand dollars  
	you mean you went to the ocean beach because there was greenheads on the back  
	mhm  
	yeah  
	sand dollars  
	but there was a large pool and a little boy in a big pool  
	I see   
	mhm   
	xxx    
	and not all  of the water was in it  
	mhm  
	but  but there was alotof water at the other pool  
	at  at which other pool  
	the big pool or the little pool  
	the big pool  
	ahhah  
	which one did you like the best  
	the little one  
	hm  
	the little one  
	xxx   
	was the   how was the water  
	was it cold  
	hm  
	we was dining the hole  
	you were digging a hole  
	that's right  
	and do you remember your lips turned blue  
	laughs  
	lip turning blue  
	lips turned blue  
	very cold  
	remember that  
	that's what little boys are for during the summertime  
	you put them in the water until they turn blue  
	without that summer is not complete  
	poor Sabina kept looking at Charlie as we  as Judy and I oohed and aahed over Charlie's blue lips  and Sabina kept saying  
	 are mine blue  
	hopefully  
	nothing was happening to Sabina  
	she looked just fine  
	she's too tough  
	she is  
	she's tough and older too  
	quite right  
	she showed Charlie a bunch of  of -uh  comic books and   
	hum   
	Charlie kept saying to me   
	 read to me  Mom  
	 read to me  
	and they were all in German  
	mhm  
	Sabina carefully would read them to him in German  
	uhhuh

	she had a Tom and Jerry comic  didn't she  
	in German

	mm  
	a little protein  
	what I meant to say to you earlier  about -um   Mike and Judy was that they said xxx   
	I said that conceivable we would bring Sabina here for the night and then they would take us in the morning to see the tall ships

	Saturday morning at eight

	mhm  
	when I took this in to school you should have heard the teacher lamenting  as they would throw away plateful of  of cake after plateful of cake  
	mhm  
	it was just  
	as far as I can tell kids are just not  big cake and ice cream eaters  
	hm   
	an old myth   
	bum  bum  bum

	laughs  
	no  
	nope  
	not that one   
	I  think that's a dodism	hm  
	it might be  
	I'm not sure about that point  
	xxx tastes so xxx  
	I had the usual conversation with Judy about  whether or not they apparently  I forget why  
	she and Mike stayed up til one thirty or two last night discussing whether or not they would have children  
	and what their prioritys was  and what they wanted outof their lives and what kind of people they was and  xxx gotta me  
	that's pretty heavy  
	  chuckles  
	I said if you hafta  really start really considering it  it's impossible to make that kind of decision  you know  
	you looked cheery and healthy this morning  
	laughs  
	you think that would make me look sick and ill  
	well  probably  
	all the questions that you feel that you probably oughta ask  but most people don't  on how  why am I bringing these children  children 	uhhuh    
	and  what kind of life do I hope for them  
	yeah  
	laughs  
	I said sh    
	I wish I had  had  my heart had not been so -uh   heavy with Juliet   
	I would've enjoyed the opportunity to discuss with her  her attitude toward family planing and population control   
	xxx  
	do you think she has a strong  
	well  it's funny  that for  for a person who  makes a point of  dedicating herself to the solution of human problems etcetera  -uh  is to some degree   
	xxx   
	that's true   
	an idealist    -uh  to say  you should be unrestrained in your  in the reproduction of your species because essentially it's fun  which was what her defense was  
	having kids is   
	xxx   
	a  source of satisfaction to the parents  
	not necessarily that it was -uh  good for the kids or anything else  
	that  that they was a comfort in their old age and  so forth  
	what  she was saying to me was   hm   having kids   having more than one   more than two even  is okay if you're  if you're the rich and privileged class essentially  
	but  that's terribly elitist  
	because how long does she expect  uh people to be members of the class in which they presently find themselves  
	let's say  ya know  a generation down the road may be two or three  
	I mean  
	ya know  you have your Adams familys and stuff like that  
	uh  you look at  
	ya know  there was a thing in Time magazine this week on descendants of the  -uh   of the original founding fathers   
	xxx   
	and they're plumbers an  and whatever  ya know   
	mhm   
	mhm  
	uh and there's no guarantee that  that  wh when you're talking about a problem the consequences of which   are not really gonna be f  
	well  they will be felt immediately  
	but I think she xxx    
	but if you're talking about   
	a problem that is going to become critical in say one more generation or two more generations  
	mhm  
	by which time you have no reason to expect that your progeny are gonna have the same  
	values  
	well  or the  or the same resources that you're gonna hafta bring up their children as uh xxx  
	but what she assumes is that your progeny    
	nondependents   
	are much brighter than  than the average American's brightness  
	okay  that  that in itself is false  
	even if they are  brighter it doesn't mean that they're gonna be  economically self sustaining  
	and even if they are economically self sustaining they're gonna take up space and they're gonna compete for  resources with everybody else   
	Ma  I dropped some  
	they're gonna buy  ya know  
	what was before the family  -uh   the family acreage on Nantucket   
	I spilled some   
	I spilled some  I spilled some  I spilled some  
	was gonna split between the three   
	that's okay  sweetie  
	male heirs or however they  decide to split it   
	I spilled some    
	I spilled some  I spilled some    
	I  I agree but y your speaking from   the conservationist's point of view  and it would be interesting to hear  
	well  e  even  even from a human -uh  from an aesthetic point of view in which she want     
	I spilled some    
	I spilled some  I spilled some  I spilled some  I spilled some    
	I think there's some  supposed to be  what twice as many people in the  by the year two thousand or  something like that  
	does she want that  
	I don't know whether she  
	I spilled  I spilled  I spilled   
	it seems to me she's taking very much in the attitude of  
	 I find pleasure in it right now and it's somebody else's problem later  
	you think that's the way she's viewing it  
	I spilled it  
	I spilled     
	I think she's caught  in a funny position in that she's now very much of a  a women's movement member  
	hm  
	but where  she spent her life bringing up her children 	uhhuh   
	until they was  high school age  
	mhm  
	  hiccups  
	you can't really say  that was a total waste of time  
	mhm  
	first of all she doesn't believe it   
	yeah    
	we want water    
	secondly  she  doesn't wanna believe it  
	yeah  
	  shouts  
	see what I'm aiming at is that arguments for population control don't say that uh  that bringing up children is a waste   by any means  
	mhm  
	huh  
	yeah  
	it acknowledges the fact that children are  ya know  a rare and  xxx  unique  pleasure  
	xxx   
	and so xxx it's just like alotof other rare and unique pleasures like  driving a twelve cylinder car at eighty miles an hour  
	at times  you just can't do it in a world of finite resources   
	it seems to me that ya  -uh  
	I can understand two  but more than two  no matter  how talented and clever you may think you are  
	if you're talented and clever enough to feel those people who aren't will have too many children then you hafta more than make up for your share xxx too many    
	well  that's another thing    
	it just gets a little funny because first it's distinctly  
	ya know  people say that  
	hey  hey  hey  hey   
	uhhuh   
	hey you  
	that's no good  
	if you don't wanna eat it that's okay too  
	but I don't want you playing with it  
	no good to play  
	I'm just    
	ya know what's a good thing to eat with   
	-um  your spoon   
	spoon is very good for cake  
	spoon is much better for cake for you   
	what she expresses alotof concern for  and seems to have a genuine concern for  is reflected in the programs in the Y and so forth  
	ya know  the  the disenfranchised  the disadvantaged  the poor  the needy and so forth and so on  
	-uh  and then she turns around and says  that  -uh   
	what are you doing  what are you doing  what are you doing  
	whaddaya  what do you  whaddaya  what do you  whaddaya  what do you  
	you as members of the upper middle class shouldn't restrain from having children  because yours are gonna be  yours are gonna be    
	but they should    
	because Pr's are     
	yeah   
	I mean  that's the obvious implication  
	it is  
	it's true  
	which  which strikes me as  ya know   elitist in the extreme  
	well  it is  
	you're quite right   
	it makes her  so obviously contented  
	that   
	uhhuh  
	may explain why  she has so much trouble getting along with the people she    
	xxx   
	hasta deal with  
	I wanna fix my xxx  
	I hate to say that I go both ways  
	not so much on the issue of  of -um    
	xxx   
	having more than two   but when I talk to her I'm  she or somebody like her and they say  you should have more   
	Ma  xxx xxx   
	what fun it is  I find myself saying right   that's great   
	Ma  please get me outof here  
	first I hafta clean you off  
	would you wait here
