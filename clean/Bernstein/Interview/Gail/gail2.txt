	she's into counting these days  and you're into counting 
	what's her ability to count 
	we're  my husband as I are curious about that 
	um she kinda picked up her letters quite spontaneously and  I haven't really pressed here to count 
	but she came home from her play group counting  one day 
	and I thought it was primarily becauseof repetition she picked up from her  peers 
	 but  my husband and I are  wondering if she  doesn't have one to one correspondence 
	now  today she didn't demonstrate that very well 
	but we saw her playing by herself one night  after he'd come home from work 
	we were talking in the kitchen  and she  just naturally sort of took herself off to her play area 
	and she had some wooden spools and she had them  in a semicircle she'd arranged in front of her  and  was playing quite happily and counting out loud 
	so my husband and I sort a  of observed her from the doorway and then  he was quite amazed 
	and he also wondered the same thing 
	we hadn't discussed it together 
	and he went out  and he asked her how many there were  and she counted one to one  up to six  and there were six of them 
	he removed one  and he asked her how many there were  and she said  I've forgotten whether she counted up to five or whether she just said 
	 five 
	whereupon  we decided that  really  there was something happening with her that was definitely  a little advanced 
	so we've  you know  we've encouraged her to count  but  I hadn't given her any formal counting 
	you know  other than  being exposed to this book  which is sequential 
	I mean  I hadn't sat down and taught her  one  two  three 
	and neither had he  and neither had my daughter 
	and I've quizzed the babysitter  and she hadn't either  so  either she's picking this up quite spontaneously  whether she has real one to one is still questionable  but 
	it's something you're interested in knowing the answer to  obviously 
	or if  if she's so fascinated  she lies and counts  by herself 
	with pleasure 
	I mean  it gives her great pleasure to  to  count and  if that is so  then  then  definitely maybe we should encourage that 
	or  give her an environment  that will  promote it 
	it's not uncommon for skills to be uneven at her age  sothat one time she can do it and not another  it may hafta do with when she initiates and when other people initiate 
	when things are done under the child's initiative  they tend to be better done 
	I see 
	well  today  obviously  I was trying to get her to  to  to um get into it  and she was not interested in that 
	and  she substituted that at one point  I think 
	the counting for the colors 
	I don't remember that 
	I asked her how many  no I asked her what color the crayons were  and  because I'd asked her earlier to count  she decided 
	 mother  get off my back 
	does she have blocks at home 
	I've forgotten 
	yes  she does 
	does she do anything with  them 
	yes  she does amazing things with um the flat wooden blocks  which she got for Christmas 
	she plays with occasionally  -um  but  re her babysitter recommended that I buy her the bristle blocks 
	and they are  incredibly wonderful 
	and she  every night  creates something with them 
	and  they are very interesting blocks 
	they s   they  they go perpendicular or  this way  and you can construct buildings  you can construct 
	she was more interested in  destruction  she was less interested in building things than in knocking them over 
	does she do that at home 
	she does not have a  toy telephone  and as a result  she really enjoys real phone conversations 
	and she does talk to her daddy  regularly 
	and occasionally her friends 
	my husband would not let me buy her one 
	because she had a doll on her  one crib machine  and he felt that was so expensive to go out and spend five or six dollars on one   or even just to have another toy was  a little  doubling it up 
	and I  acquiesced 
	this one was only a buck ninety nine 
	I know it  was  still I think it's the principle of the thing too and it  there are so few ways that I can please my husband  but I found no trouble  and also  I found it very interesting to see her go into a playroom and seek it out 
	and -uh everybody has them  so  really she doesn't 
	at home does she ask for help 
	if we're working together  I sometimes volunteer it  for instance  if we're doing a puzzle together   or she might be playing with a puzzle and decide that she would like help and she will come to me and ask for help 
	she was more comfortable in the chair  than on the floor 
	does she prefer to play in a specific area rather than run around  does she have a play area at home 
	yes 
	she does have a play corner 
	and she doesn't run loose  she's very categorical about her toys  she likes to   they're always picked up at night and put into little baskets or whatever sothat they're not all jumbled together 
	she doesn't have anything like that at home  does she 
	no 
	she has a  small table  with a free standing chair 
	and that's where she plays  she plays in that corner 
	oh  no  that's in the kitchen actually 
	she does some work there 
	she has a standing up cha  table in the  um play area  with a dollhouse that she found at a garage sale last week  it's a FisherPrice  one of those expensive houses that  we found for two dollars and fifty cents with crayon marks all over it  and it had some furniture in it 
	and -uh  we cleaned it up  and it's  it's beau  she has been playing with that for  the last week 
	with her  little  little people 
	that's interesting  because she was very confined in her play 
	she wanted to be there 
	you urged her to climb back into the chair by herself  and she couldn't 
	does she do any climbing around things 
	oh yes  she's  she capable of climbing in and outof  well  in fact  her playpen  her  crib   she climbed outof her crib when she was  I've forgotten when it was  it was a couple of months ago  and it's a very high crib 
	and we hadta dismantle it and  put her in a youth bed 
	she has not been containable once she wants to get outof something 
	or into it 
	she's  she'll climb into her playpen  if it's set up for another visiting child  she'll climb into it  with no  problem 
	and she's very capable of climbing 
	discussion of Gail's knowledge of 
	 what animals say 
	she knows all the animal sounds 
	I found it rather boring to go  you know  ask her to emote  actually  I don't normally do it  just for lack of  something else to think about 
	 you asked her at one point  
	 what kind of animal is that 
	and  ofcourse  the word animal is sort of abstract compared with the word dog  do you think she understands that concept 
	yes  because we've been to the  zoological  uh museum at Harvard  we've seen the museum about four time this spring  to look at the aninals  animals   and um she's also been to Stoneham zoo three or four times  so she knows the difference between  she knows the difference between the zoological museum and the zoo  I mean  she knows that they're in cages and  glass cages  and they don't move  and she does know what an animal is 
	this time you asked about boy and girl 
	last time she was fairly silent about that  this time  you asked about the dragon  and she said 
	 yes  I'm good  and I'm a girl 
	so 
	does she indicate when you're out shopping for instance  that she knows the difference between a little boy and a little girl 
	oh  yes 
	and in pictures  she can identify from dress  which is the boy and which is the girl  although she still  not sure about her friends  for instance 
	she goes to a playgroup with -uh primarily girls  except one little boy baby  and Andrew's always crying and he's always miserable  you know  so probably if you say 
	 he's a little boy 
	to  it connotes  that he's always crying  but her friends  Jesse and Matthew  who are very much boys and very much friends of hers  I don't know  she's not really clear about the sex  sexual subject I think 
	but we've been talking about  big boys and big girls  little boys and little girls 
	you also said 
	 what's your name 
	 what's his name 
	 does she understand the concept of a name for something 
	I don't think she has the concept 
	she has names for all her dolls  but we've named them  as they came along 
	all  all her dolls and many of her animals  I don't know really if she does understand  what your name is  in that sense  as a label 
	but she does understand names of people  she knows she knows who's who 
	likewise  you asked her 
	 how old are you 
	likewise  that's a routine  right 
	both of those things  I'm sorry  the name I've been trying to teach her how to say 
	 my name is Gail 
	when she's asked  and to ask another little friend of hers if she's meeting somebody in the park 
	 what is your name 
	 my name's Gail 
	and we've done this in the car  as a kind of exercise aswellas 
	 how old are you 
	and  I don't think she  has gotten the 
	 how old are you 
	bit into her head at all 
	this is incase she gets lost 
	yes 
	Lexington 
	I think 
	she knows that we live in Lexington  but I don't think she really remembers it out  of context 
	she's still into the Pat the bunny book  what shrts  sorts of books is she into reading these days 
	well  she can recite  if you ask her  she knows all of Peter rabbit 
	she knows all of make way for ducklings  she knows all of this  all of that  everything and  she's reading alotof her old  her older sister's books  vintage  when she was four or five years old  she loves stories with content  I got these little golden books  Hansel and Gretl  loves it  and she seems to be able to sit through to the very end  just enjoying the words 
	with the doll with all the funny parts on it  she indicated that she wanted to fool around with the parts but she wasn't really able to do most of those things herself 
	which ones of those skills do you feel she has the ability to do 
	um well  the zipper  she knows how to  zipper herself 
	but you hadta hold it down for her 
	well  that zipper's  well  she doesn't get it started  and then zip up  but she can zip a zipper  and has been able to do that on her  harness  on her sweater up and down  and manipulate zippers for a long the  I just find that the snap on that is still  what I said last time  which was you can't open it  you can't close it 
	it's frustrating  and the button is  to her  I think she's in  she knows what a buttonhole is  
	I don't think she's  ever buttoned  and um the shoelaces 
	we fool around with laces  but I haven't taught her how to tie 
	she's she's interested in watching me tie her shoes 
	can she untie her shoes 
	oh yes 
	unties everyone's shoes 
	you pointed out his hair  his hat  his hands 
	she's been very interested in  she turned last week to her favorite doll and she was sleeping with and giving a bottle  and she suddenly turned  around and said  
	 she has  hands 
	 little fingers on them 
	and it looked so cute 
	I remembered it  and today  she mentioned that he had hands  and said 
	 does he have 
	what else  she mentioned the digits there  so 
	you said 
	 put your hand in the dragon  and make him come alive 
	do you think she understands that 
	yes  because we have a rabbit at home  that she  a puppet  that  she enjoys having me control  but then she also enjoys  talking to him 
	she enjoys him both ways  she likes him inanimate  and she likes  she likes to pretend he's real  to a certain extent 
	www 
	I noticed that  when I was going through some of the  play  imaginary 
	we've been doing that with her dolls   to  with her little doll house that she picked out 
	she really thinks it's her thing 
	it is 
	but my husband comes home  and his voice goes way up  imitates him 
	 and she'll come and she's very serious about it  and she brings the little mannequin to the door  and that opens  and then some  some other animal or  figure  and his voice is  way up there 
	but she really believes it  but then  every now and then  you see her eyes looking at the real person who's doing the real sounding and  something's going on there  and today  while I was doing the dragon  she kind of  got alotof eye contact  for a minute  and it was very cute 
	it was funny  she wanted to feed it cheese  and toast  and  bananas 
	are those her favorite foods 
	she's been starved for three days ever since her attack of gastroenteritis 
	and yesterday was just a nightmare for her 
	she kept going to the refrigerator and saying 
	 well  how about some pickles 
	or 
	 how about a donut 
	and it was just killing 
	it was so difficult 
	and today was the first time she's had  bananas  and  wheat cereal without any milk  in three or four days 
	and she's just so delighted that she had crackers and chicken noodle soup for lunch 
	and she's just   she's loved again 
	so she's got  she's got things that she wants to eat on her mind  definitely  yeah 
	she'd love to eat some cheese 
	she's not gonna have it for a few more days 
	she thought the meat was toast 
	she knows what meat is 
	but  apparently  toast probably appeals to her right now  a lot  she'd like to have a nice piece of bread 
	she really would like it 
	so she's probably
