	I don't know 
	I guess I said 
	 night night 
	and  she can identify with that 
	feeding it  dinner and  it's things that she does herself  I guess 
	she thinks it's fun to do it  with something else 
	like  some kids do it with dolls  but she doesn't play with dolls  I don't know why not  So  I mean this is sort of like a doll to her 
	Mami  
	does she have anything that's sort of like a doll  
	she has lotsof dolls  half a dozen dolls 
	but she doesn't try to put them to sleep 
	or  feed them meat  or 
	nothing  Nothing  she just  you know  she just  smile at them but  she just  she doesn't play with dolls like I thought she would 
	what do you think about the dragon besides its function is so attractive to her 
	 She could have fed the dog or the boy 
	I think it's the fact that I was  making  the dragon move 
	and it was 
	but she isn't interested in putting her own hand in there 
	no  I hadta be there to do it 
	that's the main thing 
	does she have any puppets 
	-uh  yeah 
	yeah 
	does she play with them 
	no  but she enjoys it when  I play with them  with her 
	it's  I think it's a function of me doing it 
	does she try to feed  you have a  dog 
	we have cats 
	yeah  but she sees dogs  They're around 
	 does she feed the cats 
	yes 
	she feeds  she feeds  she loves to feed the cats 
	she wants to feed them everytime she sees them 
	you know  it's a big event 
	does she feed them the way she's trying to feed the dragon or does she just dump food into the dish and walk away 
	um I'll put food in the dish  and she'll carry the dish and set it down and watch the cats eat 
	so 
	so she's not doing what she's doing here  
	no 
	what sort of toys is she most interested in right now 
	she loves puzzles  and I read alotof books to her  -um 
	as much as you can read at that age 
	does she have any particularly favorite books 
	-um  I have one called 
	 Good night  Moon 
	that she likes 
	why do you think that's  
	because she's really intrigued with the moon 
	why don't you play over here 
	see all the fun toys 
	ya wanna sit in here  again 
	okay 
	are there any other toys that she's really interested in 
	-um  let me think  um she has a little  record player  where she puts the records on and  there's no plugs or anything  it's really nice by FisherPrice  one of those preschool things  she makes the records play little tunes and  she really likes that 
	and  -um  I bought her a little cup and saucer set  and she's into that  pretending like she's drinking outof that 
	that kind of thing  She likes outdoor things 
	riding her little tricycle and  In fact that's all she wants to do is go outside and play  this year 
	the first thing in the morning 
	 outside outside 
	but she will  if shut in her room  play with toys otherwise  I hafta be involved 
	or she follows me around and helps me do chores around the house She likes to do things that I do 
	like um well  she'll unload the dishwasher for me  you know  plate by plate  glass by glass 
	so she's not so interested in toys as she is in doing things 
	like  I don't know  She seems  Dale She seems like she loses interest in toys very quickly 
	and  I'll buy her something that I'll think she'll be interested  she'll play with it a little while and  that's it 
	I don't know 
	she likes real things 
	um like she  uh she likes to get into my pots and pans and spoons and things  that kind of thing 
	or   something unique  like clothespins  she likes to help me hang the wash 
	by handing me the clothespins  Dale gets loud  the doggie and the dragon had houses and homes 
	does she understand those concepts 
	yes  she says house when she sees house 
	real houses 
	yeah  she says house you know  we'll be going along  and she'll point and she'll go house 
	so she does know what a house is 
	on the doll and on the dragon  you pointed out some body parts  What sorts of body parts is she aware of 
	she knows all of them  I think so  because she even said eyes	and she recognizes that what's in the dragon's mouth is a tongue 
	yeah  I think so 
	where's the tongue  Dale 
	hIdang	see  she said tongue 
	she was into taking things in and out   does she like that  
	yes 
	yes 
	she likes taking things in and out 
	I don't know what she was doing but I have a potted plant  and she was taking out little cupfuls of dirt  and going over and pouring it out and coming back and going  you know this thing went on for a long time  I finally taught what is she doing 
	all this dirt  under the rug 
	but  little things like that  she does like 
	you asked her a couple of times what her name was 
	does she know what the names of things are 
	yes 
	she calls some people by name 
	she calls people by name  but does she understand the term 
	 your name or it's name 
	I think so  because  sometimes she'll answer with her name  but  it's just been in the past week or two  But  she calls alotof people by their names  xxx  she knows their names 
	when she reads books  she does that only with you  not by herself 
	once in a great while  she'll read a book by herself 
	but  it's very short  and mostly she'll bring it to me if I'm around  or her father 
	will she turn the pages by herself 
	she'll try  it depends if they're those thick pages  um I don't think she can turn those thin ones yet 
	unless it's just grabbing and that kind of thing she really can't turn pages that well 
	when she gotta the part about 
	 Mommys ring 
	she really didn't compare it to her own 
	do you think that's too abstract for her  
	-um  I think she was  just kinda bored with it 
	 She has that book 
	I got her that book 
	and  when you get towards the end  she sort a  of loses interest  so I think it was 
	 she didn't play with the blocks 
	yeah  she's not into blocks very much any more 
	except to throw them 
	do you have any feeling why they're not very interesting to her any more 
	I don't know  She has alotof blocks at home  but   she doesn't stack them or anything 
	she likes to throw them if anything 
	so I don't know why not 
	she seems to treat the dog appropriately 
	how does she know what to do  
	um well  maybe because  the cats get fed  maybe she's seen people walking dogs  -um  like the paperboy always has a dog run along with him when he delivers the paper  She knows what dogs are 
	I guess it is from observing 
	I don't really know 
	never thought about that 
	she wasn't very much into the phone today 
	she never has been 
	when I come here 
	someone said that phone just doesn't look very much like a phone 
	she has toy phones  but she doesn't play with those  either 
	but  she does talk on the real phone  now and then  like her father calls every day from work  and she'll say hi and goodbye  and uh she likes the phone  it's a big deal when it rings  and everything  but  I don't know  she just doesn't play  One time I heard her talking away on her play phone 
	I guess it depends on her mood 
	maybe if anybody's watching 
	that could be 
	she was all by herself  just in her room  talking up a storm 
	of gobbledygook talk  you know  not  laughs 
	if you can call it that 
	with these goobly	You don't say things like 
	 can you say this 
	are you unconcerned about how well pronounced her words are 
	well  I want her to have a good pronunciation  but  I figure  it comes naturally  I don't wanna  I don't wanna act like a teacher 
	I don't care if she doesn't perform perfectly at two years old  but  if by the time she's three  and she still isn't  then maybe I'll  I would take a different viewpoint  or maybe with a different child  I don't know what's  normal  What's  proper and what's not 
	I think it's neat that she's talking and saying things  and 
	 she's pretty vocal on her own  I just figure  I'd rather have her talk  and enjoy talking and not worry about how it sounds 
	just  anything she wants to say  and worry about the pronunciation later  if you needta 
	if a stranger says 
	 can you say that 
	what does she do 
	you mean like adults that come and say that to her 
	I guess because I have heard people come up and say 
	 what's your name 
	and so  I'm teaching her to answer with her name  and probably  as more of those things happen  I'll respond 
	she's very talkative to people  She'll always say Hi and Byebye  and  it seems like she talks a lot for people 
	she's already talkative 
	so  I guess  maybe just to say her name  but seems like she satisfies people at the present time  laughs
