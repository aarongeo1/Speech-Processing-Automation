	she wasn't too entranced with the phone this time  she wasn't last time  either 
	I don't think so 
	she has one at home right like it 
	uh Just like it 
	go put those on a chair  Go on 
	go get them 
	 does she use it 
	not really 
	I think the novelty's worn off 
	what does she do with a real phone 
	she immediately runs  to where it is 
	and  gets all excited 
	loves to pull on the cord if I don't keep it outof reach 
	and  when she listens to voices  uh smiles 
	but won't say a word 
	does she understand where the voices are coming from 
	I don't know 
	does she recognize if you say 
	 Come here and talk on the phone 
	she'll come  well she'll run to it immediately when it rings  um she won't talk on it herself 
	you mentioned playing with the chair  and the chair's just like her chair  Does she play  xxx 
	no  not at all  She has a little rocking chair  like -uh  one of the little pictures 
	 do you think she recognizes that it's just like hers 
	I don't think so 
	she didn't uh really  respond when I  yeah 
	you tried a bunch of prepositions with her 
	you tried going up  putting things in  taking things out  told her that something was upside down  How many of these words do you think she recognizes  
	I think all of them 
	she says up all the time 
	when she wants up 
	and she says down when she wants down 
	not as much as up 
	that's her favorite word  um I think she understands almost all of them 
	I don't think I've used upside down before 
	she knows to take things out 
	does she put things in and out 
	oh yeah 
	yeah 
	she'll put things  like um her dirty clothes in her clothes basket 
	she can follow alotof directions put it in there  out there 
	she won't play with the blocks 
	has the novelty worn off 
	I shouldn't have done that  
	I won't get her a dragon  laughs 
	what does she do with blocks when she has them 
	she stacks them 
	and  oh  she loves to throw them  that's the latest thing 
	smaller ones  though  that she throws 
	but she's definitely not into them these days 
	um depends on her mood 
	um  sometimes she is  but  not today 
	does she have the Pat the Bunny book at home 
	no 
	you say 
	 let's read a book  let's look at the pictures 
	does she understand that concept 
	yeah  for at home she will 
	yeah 
	does she have any favorite ones 
	um she has a little book with nursery rhymes  that she really likes 
	and  uh She  I don't know  she sort a  of seems like she's losing her interest in books  that she had a few months ago  She used ta  just pester continually  with the book  you know  just follow you around the house  but  she seems  she'll even sit and read one on her own  now 
	read  I mean  you know  look at the pictures 
	she has about  eight or ten books 
	that's it 
	again you pointed out boys and girls  Dale gets noisy 
	probably not  laughs 
	she doesn't say  little boy  little girl 
	no  not at all 
	do you make an effort to do that 
	I don't  maybe I do  I don't know 
	I did that  I must   I did in the book 
	and maybe I do  I didn't think that I do 
	does she have little boy and girl friends 
	yes 
	well  mostly little boys actually 
	there's one little girl  but she's a bit older 
	there's not many little girls around where she is 
	she tried to smell the flowers 
	does she try to do that at home  in the backyard 
	 I've seen her doing it  She likes to touch them  I just  I just said that because it said smell the flowers 
	that's the first time I ever said  I didn't even know she knew the word smell 
	you saw her looking in the mirror and said 
	 who's that 
	do you think she knows 
	we look in the mirror together  I don't know if I say 
	 who's that 
	maybe I do 
	do you think she understands that that's her 
	I don't know 
	I  I'm not sure 
	 She didn't seem to remember what shoes are  do you play with them at home 
	she knows  yeah  in fact  um I don't know if you saw it  but she started playing with her own shoes  when I said that 
	she  she wasn't interested in the doll's shoes  maybe because they don't look like shoes or something 
	she has sneakers  and sandals  she brings them to me I say go get your shoes  she'll bring them to me 
	does she try to tie them and untie them 
	yeah  she unties them  I hafta double knot them 
	all the time 
	does she try to pretty up herself or other people 
	yeah  she'll use a brush on her own hair  and  in fact  if I'm in the bathroom  doing makeup or something  she'll just always try to grab the brushes and combs 
	it's  one of her favorite things 
	 Does she drink outof a cup do you call it a cup 
	some  well  she has some things I call cups  and others that I call glasses 
	I think she knows cup but  -um  she just wasn't that interested in the pictures so I don't know 
	 but it broke apart and I never got her a new one  but whenever she's sees my keys  just do anything to get hold of them   Lately we've noticed that she offers her cheek for a kiss 
	so that's they way xxx 
	 you used the term 
	 food 
	it's a pretty broad term  do you think she knows 
	-um  I think so  When it's lunchtime I'll say  let's go  let's go   noise lunch  Dale cries  Well  I'll say  
	 Let's  are you ready for lunch 
	she'll just  drop what she's doing and run into the kitchen  and shake her high chair 
	I use eat  yes  I do  I don't think meat  comes up very much  though 
	I don't think that means anything to her 
	she knows  no  I'll say  I'll say 
	 ya want some more chicken 
	or  hot dog  or sandwich  um food might be to entice her to the table  at the very beginning  but I am specific about what she eats  xxx 
	yeah  she says it  too 
	 When she wants more  Yeah  if she's eating
