	she's got several books  not like this 
	this is one of the cutest books I've ever seen  it's a  an old one 
	it's cute 
	um she's got one of these  she likes to put things -uh   you know  but she doesn't have any  she has a Raggedy Ann doll  but  she's got some stuffed animals  but  two cats 
	um I don't  I really don't know  if she's that familiar with dogs 
	-uh  there is a dog where she  sometimes goes to the babysitter  named Suchi  um in fact he looks like that little  stuffed dog  but  I don't really know if she sees him there or not 
	one of them's kitty  and the other one has another name 
	um no  we just started calling it that  and 
	yeah  very small ones 
	she stacks them 
	throws them 
	carries em around  as many as she can at once 
	um I thought she might know kitty  but that's about the only thing 
	I don't think so 
	she might know boy 
	she's been exposed to ducks  but I don't know how well she knows those  she loves them 
	she brings them to me  and makes me go through them over and over 
	and you know  sometimes she sits 
	like that  by herself 
	she looks at them 
	she's got  a Raggedy Ann and a  another  soft  no  she's got three of them  and a big one  but she just isn't interested 
	yeah  just sit around 
	um not as much as we useta 
	um just -uh  peekaboo and you know  behind -uh  objects  or  sometimes when she's eating in her high chair   Dale's voice over this last part I don't know 
	it's just  you said it was a dragon  so  I just thought of it as being a dragon 
	yeah  I know what you mean  I 
	 it just never occurred to me to think of  you know it's a dragon  so that's what I called it 
	she has a puppet 
	sometimes she likes it 
	she'll make that little noise  like she made with the dog 
	very loving to it  and other times  she could care less about it 
	no  and that was a new routine  I'd never done that with her 
	yeah  she feeds herself 
	yeah  combs and brushes  Dale's voice over this she'll brush her hair  she'll try to brush my hair 
	oh  did I 
	I just called it a bunny because it said bunny  on it  so  I don't think I've ever  no 
	I think I've always used the word bunny  no  rabbit 
	yeah  it seems like an easy thing to memorize  you know  one  two  three  four  I don't think so 
	yeah  she has a number book at home  Dale's voice over number one raccoon  two  something  it goes through a list of animals 
	seven bunnies  laughs 
	yeah  she lifts it up and goes that  allo  hello  allo  hello  allo  hello  you know 
	and  whenever the phone rings  if like sometimes her father calls from work and all that  I'll put it to her ear  and let her hear his voice 
	she never says a word  but a big smile comes on her face 
	she's got two toy ones 
	one of them's just like this  a different color  and the other one  is more of a pulltoy  it kind of  it has little eyes on it that roll up and down  and  makes kind of a clicking sound when you pull it and its  its  vividly colored 
	I really don't know 
	she useta wrap this one around her neck and walk around the house with it 
	so  but she does do that 
	 hello  hello 
	s   so  you know  so as though she had some connection 
	she runs to the phone 
	it's a big event 
	it's not when she's done playing 
	it can happen any time 
	with any number of things  she likes to put things  in drawers and shut the drawers   I'll find toys  in dresser drawers  and  just all over the place 
	she likes to  seems to like to put things in a  an orderly way 
	not every time  um once in a while I tell her  but  she does it on her own for the most part  put it away  something like that 
	I think she knows put 
	put it away  yeah
