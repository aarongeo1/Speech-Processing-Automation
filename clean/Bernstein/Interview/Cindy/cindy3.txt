	no  not at all 
	another two months 
	see where she's at 
	okay   sure 
	 she's really into the books now 
	is that true generally 
	she has tons of books 
	Walt Disney books  every story and  she just loves to read all day long and go through them in her crib when she's sposta be napping  I can hear her in there  and she's saying what is in the books  what we've read to her 
	we have the cat in the hat she'll repeat in the cat in the hat all the things that they picked up  in the order  and I'm not sure how she knows them 
	 I don't remember  laughs 
	she's incredible 
	she seems to have a good memory for this sort of stuff 
	she has an incredible memory 
	does she have any favorite ones 
	um well  the cat in the hat  the  rhyming books she doesn't like anymore  there were  some  um doctor Seuss other rhyme books  that she useta like 
	mom came in 
	 would you please go now 
	was one  then she liked that really well  and then it just got  so she doesn't pick that up so often 
	she loves Mickey mouse books  happy birthday book  that's the best 
	am	when's her birthday 
	September ninth 
	she was two a couple of weeks ago 
	some of the books were just names of things books 
	she seems to have acquired quite a large vocabulary  although I couldn't always tell what she was saying  do you think she had any particular problems with any of those  any of the pictures or words  
	no  not really 
	she's very aware 
	you're getting very specific with her now  she's talking about things like 
	 what are things for 
	what is the cup for  what are the keys for 
	 what type of chair is that 
	 do you deliberately try to build up vocabulary that way 
	I just have  we just  she just wants to learn 
	so much  it's just  so why say the same thing 
	so does she get things like keys are to drive from you  or does she pick it up on her own 
	she picks up some things on her own some times she knows  well  she sees where they go 
	they keys  she says 
	 mommy's keys 
	or 
	 daddy's keys 
	and  basically  mine open the house and daddy's drive the car  laughs 
	you know  he has more on his key chain 
	but  she makes some up where they go  but  she's got a bit of imagination  don't cha  you  
	this time  unlike last time  instead of calling the kitties kitty	 cat 
	oh  laughs 
	she's getting older 
	she still calls it a kitty  or kI	 have you decided she's too old for words like that 
	no  I  the cats are growing up  the kitten that grandma had is now a cat  and our cat's an  eight year old cat  uh it's just she's getting older  and there 
	xxx 
	um he was kitty 
	I think kitty was easier to say for her as a beginner but i	 she called the pancakes 
	 cakes 
	does she think they look like cakes  or is she only getting part of the word when you say it to her 
	no  she says 
	 pancake 
	I don't think she thought it was a cake 
	 and then you said 
	 hotcakes 
	it started with an h	there's another different word for the same thing 
	she couldn't figure out what the jelly beans were  you named them for her 
	has she ever seen a jelly bean 
	no I try not to show her those things 
	we try not to 
	lollipops are about the only thing she's gotten into  and maybe one piece of chocolate 
	but  no  I try to steer clear of those aisles 
	then there are words in these books that she has no experience with 
	yeah  that's true  yeah 
	at the end of the book  she pointed to all of the things  and she called them all 
	 toy 
	 she understands  things are toys 
	yes  they are  she has her toys  she has her books  and she has  other things  that are  that other  categories  and I'm not sure what the categories are 
	some parents say they make a distinction by saying 
	 that's not a toy 
	I probably said that  about some certain things around that she shouldn't have played with  there are  daddy's tape recorder  so that's not a toy  do not play with it  it's a  and I try to explain to her what it is  it's a mechanical piece of equipment  laughs and she doesn't know how to deal with  and when she learns how to run it she can play with it  then 
	but  it is not a toy 
	she wasn't real interested in the truck book 
	no 
	she was interested on  on the mass pike this morning 
	about the buses and trucks going by  but  not the trucks 
	we don't have any trucks 
	I don't have  -uh  the little cars she's played with  but that's about it 
	does she have any boy friends 
	yes  she does 
	one that's one month  younger  than her  and we're in a play group together  so we see Richard every week 
	oh yeah  he's got boy's toys 
	she does know boy versus girl now  she was sort of developing that 
	yes  yes 
	 she's into numbers now she always put one	one  or whatever she'll count to see if it's one  two  she's doing really well up to four  and then five  goes a little crazy 
	 I think it has a lot to do with Sesame street and Ernie and Bert 
	they have the counting 
	the froggie  too 
	 she thought the boy had a ball on his head 
	a baseball 
	she thought it had a baseball  in his hand  Richard plays with baseballs  all the time  and she thought it was a ball  not a hat  she's not useta hats 
	she's never worn one  and  she's always had so much hair  I never bothered with it 
	 she never had a cap 
	she was really into colors 
	she's been into colors a lot  a long time  she walks around  and she'll say colors in front of something  and the word she's saying  like a red chair  red spoon  in fact like she picked it out in the book  what is that  it's a red spoon   in drawing and coloring  we do this all the time  she draws different colors of apples  red apples  or she'll want a green apple 
	 I can't imagine what it will be like  pumpkins 
	www 
	you tried to point out to her the difference between a regular chair and a rocking chair  does she know the difference  
	we have a rocking chair and a regular chair at home  with rockers on the bottom 
	she didn't really know what you were getting at  
	 she doesn't just know flowers  she knows kinds of flowers 
	from the garden 
	the garden's been great 
	 not really  because basically all that's zinnias or marigolds  they're alright 
	xxx 
	I'm not sure I tell her what they are  the roses only came out only two  they just came out about a week ago  so she gotta see another rose  and vine  but the zinnias and the marigolds  they're about six feet tall   they're just way above her head  and all she wants to do is pick the flowers  when she goes out 
	I'll pick this flower 
	www 
	well  she useta wear one  they're around they're still in the house  and I try  if she's wearing something nice  I would put it on her  but  I usually   feed her in her jammies 
	 and she's pretty neat now with eating  so it's not that necessary 
	she talked about having 
	 toast and tea 
	is that what mother has for breakfast 
	yes  laughs 
	very familiar 
	most kids call it coffee 
	I don't drink it 
	no  we don't have it around 
	 she's useta tea  you know  not coffee 
	and eating toast in the morning 
	oh yes 
	it's in the car  right now 
	www 
	do ya wanna sit down on that chair 
	you can sit down on that chair  if you like 
	she doesn't eat outof glass bowls  the big bowls like that  and we really have a lot more plates than we have of bowls  her  her dish is a plastic dish with the three sections in it  or a wooden bowl  it's a very flat wooden bowl  she eats soup outof the plastic  three sectioned plastic bowl  but it's a whole different  very  obvious bowl  and she does eat soup outof it 
	 does she eat with all utensils now does she know spoon and every thing else 
	she's not sure what a knife is  but I don't let her have one  so  but a spoon and a fork  she can differentiate 
	she wanted to eat something really weird with a spoon 
	she's getting really good at zipping up and zipping down   does she do much of that now 
	zips the bag 
	 s her bag  
	she zips that up and down  um she unties  real well 
	she's just beginning to put shoes on her self like her tennis shoes  she knows to pull the tongue up  to make sure the strings are untied before she sticks her foot in  she's starting to take off sweaters  all by herself and shirts  that she can undo  but not  the buttoning she hasn't really paid much attention to buttoning 
	and buckling 
	her clothing  what does it have  
	it's mostly like this 
	just pullover  very  let's see  the blue jeans now have zippers in them  they were just the elastic back sort of corduroy pants  blue jeans or whatever 
	can she get in and outof them 
	the pants 
	she hasn't really tried 
	so she comes to you 
	yeah 
	she's doesn't really care  you know  one way or the other whether she has any clothes on 
	she doesn't make any  it  not really 
	she doesn't like to take anything off 
	she's just happy with what she's wearing 
	my little nudist 
	www 
	she can zip things up  but not down 
	that's because when you zip down  when you zip these pants down it's  it's open at the top  and it is hard  unless you hold the top  to get the zipper down 
	well  she's not really sure that's what she should do first 
	think what I've noticed with the bag  she's  she's been really good at unzipping them 
	but not zipping it back up 
	she didn't do much with the blocks  but she was interested in reading them 
	no  and we have some beautiful wooden blocks  too  that she just got  and she  she the only thing she'll make with them is she'll lay them flat on the floor and make a house to sit on  laughs not stack 
	whereas the little boy Richard came over to the house and he grabbed the blocks and he started automatically playing with them and stacking them on top  on top of one another 
	and she just has no desire to build 
	but she was interested in reading the blocks  and she knew something for every letter 
	just from reading the books 
	b	she started doing that 
	I xxx with the drawing  like just  draw the c	what kind of words would you have exchanged 
	 what was the b	no  she ended up finding out b	but she picked up the b	it's a weird letter 
	and cookie starts with c	yyy 
	yeah  he's your friend 
	she was pretty good at identifying the animals on the sides of the blocks 
	you talked about combing and brushing  can she comb or brush her own hair 
	she tries 
	she has the brush usually the opposite way 
	she has the hard part down on her head  and the bristles sticking up in the air 
	but she tries 
	and sometimes she gets the hair 
	is it easier for her to do it to someone else 
	for her to  do it to someone else 
	I don't know  she's 
	yeah  she can get the brush the right way  but it's hard for her to brush my hair  because she ends up tangling it up as she's doing it 
	but she's tried  dogs and dolls  well  the dog has  such slick hair that it will xxx comb it's not fuzzy 
	and Gus is so soft it's not like he has anything to comb either 
	 can she pretend that she's feeding a doll at this point 
	yes 
	she  she had a pretend tea party  and she fed all of her little  animals that were on the table  great 
	she was making all the little  sipping noises  outof playdough 
	oh  we had gotten some clay  recently she's been playing with that  and making things outof it and hotdogs  because they're easiest to roll around  but mostly  she makes daddy mommy booboo  Gus  the family and then a Cindy and maybe a Richard or a Jeffry  her little friends that she knows 
	www 
	she'll say it  and it'll be sort of a little weird  however  I repeat it so she'll get the idea that this is really how it's said 
	then when she can say it again  she usually cleans it up a little bit 
	do you hafta say 
	 say it again 
	or does she do it herself 
	 if you say the word over again  does she repeat it 
	sometimes  sometimes she doesn't 
	depends on what time she feels 
	but she  often will
