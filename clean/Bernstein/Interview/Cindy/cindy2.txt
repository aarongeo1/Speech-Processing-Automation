	we've got lotsof colors that she knows 
	she knows all her colors 
	yes 
	just  just like we did before  but now  instead of having to ask  she picked up a beach ball the other day  and told me every color  even white 
	it's great 
	seems to come through  
	what were the first colors she learned 
	pink 
	and green were the very first colors  and orange seemed to come on after that 
	red was the hardest 
	but red she can say now 
	I think she just had difficulty saying it 
	and um white didn't seem to be that hard to understand and black  seemed to be okay 
	nothing is black when you ask for colors  usually 
	the only things she wanted to do with the Peter magic doll  were his shoes and his zipper 
	she zips bags up and down  she has her little bags 
	just a sec  I'll give it to ya 
	there ya go grapes 
	geps  grapes 
	now you can go play with the books  okay 
	go look through those books 
	they're new 
	we haven't seen those books before 
	we have a ton of books at home  and she can tell me  exactly which books they are  there are some great ones called hand  hand  finger  thumb  and it has monkeys in it  and 
	hand  hand 
	that's her favorite 
	does she have any of these books at home 
	no  no  none of these 
	in the alphabet book  there were some words in there that were terribly appropriate for her  and others that were terribly inappropriate for a child her age 
	do you have a sense that there were some words she could really identify with and others that she probably didn't 
	yeah  that book especially 
	we have a doctor Seuss's abc book  and they  they  ya just  they just have different examples  and they have more or less the ones the kids can  you know  relate to 
	this  it does  it's a little over the heads  I think  for her age 
	what words especially were in it that she 
	um well  words like vanilla ice cream  I'm  I'm not sure you know  that's something  we don't have ice cream at home  and so she's not really familiar with that  vanilla ice cream and  um and jello is something  it's a word she's 
	I thought that was a good word  because it's not in our book 
	our book has something like jelly jars and  jam and  she's not really certain about that sort of thing 
	except she knows what jelly is 
	but -um 
	on the other hand  one of the books on meals had lotsof sinple  simple words  for example  you called her attention to the red bib does she wear a bib at home  
	yeah  and she's pretty good about  y yelling for it 
	bib 
	bib  laughs 
	gimme that bib 
	I try to not have her wear it lately because she's been eating outdoors or eating over at somebody else's house and picnics and that sort of thing  so she only has it when she's sitting down eating a meal in her high chair 
	she talks about drinking the milk up outof the cup  does she use a cup to drink her milk 
	yeah  she does  she has a little blue cup 
	and ya drink you juice outof it  too 
	there was a routine on feeding something to the dog 
	does she feed the dog 
	she feeds the dog all the time 
	everything she's not sposta 
	her meal 
	she'll feed the dog  laughs she'll pick out all the good stuff  here's some liver  laughs 
	here  Scoob   have some good stuff 
	 you said to her at one point  who do you see in the mirror 
	have you practiced that 
	that's hard for many of the children to do 
	um she plays with mirrors all the time 
	just  I always did when I was a little kid 
	and I remember my own fascination from it 
	so when she was in a playpen  I've always given her unbreakable mirrors to sort of play with 
	and  she's gotten into looking at lights or looking at the window or finding daddy in them or finding mommy in them besides herself 
	 do you think you help her by asking 
	 who do you see 
	oh yeah  well  first  of all  when you look in a mirror  the bathroom mirror  ofcourse  you're always holding her up and washing her face  or something  and I was always making a reference to 
	 there's Cindy 
	or 
	 look at Cindy 
	so she could see how dirty her face was or wasn't so I could wash it  laughs 
	and she would be more pleased if it were dirty to let me wash 
	so that's worked out very well 
	there were alotof words about  the garden  and that happened last time  too  you pointed out different types of flowers  the garden  the colors of things  the dirt  what kinds of things is she aware of in the garden 
	we have strawberries in our garden 
	she's very aware of those  because they're growing  the flowers have just started to come out  and my marigolds   my roses 
	go stack your blocks 
	pick all the blocks up 
	 has she started to work more with her own shoes 
	well  shoes  yes 
	she tries to put them on  and she tries to put her clothes on  her pants  that's really cute  it's a little struggle  yes  she still needs help getting dressed and everything  she doesn't totally undress herself when I'm gone  either 
	but she helps me when sh  when I'm undressing her  like getting ready for a bath  I mean she'll help 
	she's always very good when you dress her 
	ya tell her to put her arms through the holes and she will do that 
	and she's gotten her left leg  because the doctor says always 
	 left leg  laughs 
	she likes the phone 
	does she play with the phone now she was last time 
	yeah  well  her daddy's talked to her 
	he's been back and forth in NewYork with his band so he calls every once in a while 
	and she talks to him  it's really cute 
	will she actually talk on the phone 
	she'll tell him what she's done in  two or three words  like if she's gone out stroller riding 
	she went to the ocean she told him ocean 
	it so funny 
	what did she see there 
	what did she like 
	what'd you see at the ocean 
	I mean  at the aquarium 
	sUk	fish 
	did you see shark 
	sUk	big shark 
	sUk	really neat 
	do you think she knows that they're fish 
	yeah  she did appreciate them as fish 
	she knew they were fish  and  we saw the movie  which was really kind of neat afterwards  about the whale 
	and that kinda gives you an even better perspective  because those fish are real big 
	sUk	and the sharks were there 
	since they redid it  I hadn't been there for a long time  you can really stand way above it  and dive in 
	sUk	you saw the sharks  didn't ya 
	sUks	she didn't enjoy the book on trucks very much  you said  this is a truck that comes when it snows  does she understand 
	she remembered when it snowed  and she had a snowman book  I  I guess it stopped snowing about the time that we got this book  so she remembers very well when it did how and when it didn't 
	we'd always go out and make a point of it when it did 
	in one of the books  there were lotsof things she knew www 
	are those things she has had experience with  or have you made a point of teaching 
	no  she's just  those are things that she's had experience with  with food  and  she's been in the car a lot 
	is she fascinated with keys 
	she doesn't really play with my keys very much 
	she knows what they are  I don't think she really cares that much about them  they're  they start the car  and they get you in the house 
	she was very much into playing with balls last time 
	balls  yes 
	balls are great 
	in a couple of the books  you pointed out yarn 
	does she know what yarn is 
	I have yarn  but it's in balls  so  laughs that's why I said 
	 balls of yarn 
	when I talk to her  about it 
	she always points to it she knows kittens play with it she knows it unravels  it's very funny 
	and she knows her eggs because she probably eats them every day 
	she loves eggs
