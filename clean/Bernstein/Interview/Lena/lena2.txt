	how old is Lena at this point 
	she's gonna  be two October fifth  so  twenty two months 
	she knew a bunch of words in the basic vocabulary book 
	she knew about things like spoons and a cup  does she name things around the breakfast table 
	no 
	but 
	they're named 
	they're named for her 
	what are the sorts of things you name for her 
	well  it's not conscious 
	it's saying  
	 Maura  get the bowls for the cereal 
	 we need the spoon 
	 where's your napkin 
	 does anybody need more juice 
	around the table  you wouldn't say  for instance  
	 what's that 
	 that's a spoon 
	no 
	she does know what a brush is  does she use one at home 
	last night she did the most extraordinary thing 
	she  um found a comb   and she was combing my hair  and then she started to comb her hair  and she took this hand  and she gathered her hair  behind her  and started to comb it into a pony tail 
	which I thought was extraordinary 
	she uses a brush usually 
	 because she named the brush but not the comb 
	didn't name 
	 no  I was surprised 
	no  she knows comb 
	I would say she knows comb better than brush 
	because that's  what she used on the kid's hair 
	 you kept probing for that and 
	she wouldn't say it 
	no 
	xxx 
	you are dressed 
	  continues to complain 
	I'll fix it 
	she has a whole bunch of interesting phone routines 
	you say 
	 say hello  hello 
	Say 
	 how are you 
	you do that with her 
	yeah 
	she repeated one of them 
	 how are you  I am fine 
	yeah  it sounded like that 
	yeah  that's what she was  I think 
	so when she gets on a phone  she actually talks to people 
	no  when she gets on a real live phone  she doesn't say a word  but  when she's playing with a play phone  she talks   Occasionally  she'll say 
	that's Grammy 
	but 
	she doesn't just name something she'll say 
	 that's something 
	yes  talks and  uses words grammatically 
	yes  she does 
	 give it to me  Here  this is yours 
	I mean  it's all very grammatical 
	a couple of times  you asked her if she needed help with things 
	does she ask you when she needs help 
	or do you hafta intuit that she needs help 
	no  she'll ask 
	what will she say 
	she'll say 
	 Help me 
	she actually says that 
	 I didn't hear her do that 
	well under the circumstances I was right here 
	but if she was trying to do something she would come and get me  and say 
	 help me 
	 open the door 
	 I wanna go outside 
	 the dolly is stuck 
	 whatever  and she'll tell me as much as she can 
	I was going to ask if she can take her clothes on and off  and I guess I don't hafta 
	no  she can 
	are there things with her clothing that are easier for her to take on and off 
	most of her dresses have buttons in back 
	so she can't get those off 
	-um  her nightgowns that have buttons in front I hafta to pin closed 
	because she'll take them off 
	in the middle of the night 
	-um  her underpants she can't get off 
	can she put clothes on a doll 
	they   she does  but she does it  it's not that she's putting a dress on  she'll take the dress and drape it over the doll 
	or she'll go and she'll get clothes  she'll put on my shoes and becomes Mommy  and gets a bag and goes shopping 
	you asked her at one point what the doll's name was 
	does she name dolls 
	no  probed Well   Maura does  I've never watched  I don't know whether Lena necessarily knows  the names of the particular dolls  But she names people 
	 because Mommy's name is Cassy 
	and if she's Mommy  she calls me Cassy 
	isn't that interesting 
	when she named the keys  she didn't say keys  she said 
	car keys 
	well  those are Mommy's keys  and that's Where she sees them being used  in the car  because we rarely lock the house 
	you were trying to narrow down her definitions of some words  she wanted to call the sneakers shoes 
	normally  she calls sneakers sneakers  sandals sandals  slippers  slippers 
	 They're very different things 
	do you deliberately try to narrow things down like that 
	I  I may 
	I don't realize it if I'm doing it 
	I mean  I think what I probably do is say Let's put on your shoes And after a little while when shoes is a familiar things  I mean  she knows what they're for  I say 
	 let's put on your sneakers 
	 let's put on your sandals 
	 let's put on your boots 
	just   and I don't know what I do 
	you pointed out that one picture was the Cow jumps over the Moon 
	do you do nursery rhymes with her 
	not as much as I should 
	 Well  I'm just aware of what I did for Maura 
	and less for Jeff  and virtually nonexistent for this 
	does she  know rhymes like that 
	I think so 
	she likes that one 
	she always laughs when she hears about the  
	 dish ran away with the spoon 
	she thinks that  she thinks that's funny 
	does she know what the moon is 
	I doubt  I doubt it 
	I don't know 
	www 
	yes  because the last time we went to my mother's house  we did not go to the lake house and she said 
	 Where's Grammy's lake 
	lake is a very advanced term for such a young child 
	she said as we approached  as we pulled into the driveway 
	 this is Grammy's house 
	where's Grammy's lake 
	 because she had only seen the lake  once 
	www 
	she won't let go of me 
	oh  she went swimming at Lindsey's house 
	yes  she is extraordinarily good in the bathtub and the little pool 
	but once she's got the lifepreserver on in deep water  she clings 
	 you said that the bathtub is to get the baby clean 
	does she understand that 
	yes 
	she washes her face clean 
	after she has  she eats  if she spills anything on her dress  her dress hasta come off  and she hasta put on a clean dress 
	she takes the washcloth and washes her  hands  and then she  you know I say
