	she really used the phone a lot this time compared to other times 
	does she use her toy telephone at home 
	we just got a new one 
	the old one was broken 
	and has she been using it 
	I wouldn't say so  but  I may be wrong 
	does she use the real telephone  
	no  
	how does she know what to do 
	oh  that's just the telephone routine 
	she may not do it on the real telephone  but she may do it on her own telephone 
	I mean  if she's playing  I'll say 
	 call daddy and ask him what he wants for lunch 
	yes  that I will do 
	when I see it  but it doesn't happen every day 
	will she talk  if grandma calls 
	sometimes she will 
	sometimes she'll just listen 
	www 
	probably  she doesn't expect it to happen  so  and because I don't let her talk on the phone that often  it's not anything she's really accustomed to 
	www 
	no but she sees Maura's hair in the morning  and she sees me do my own  oh 
	yes she's been taking my brush 
	and brushing her hair 
	brushing my hair 
	does she brush her dolly's hair 
	-um  I have never seen her do it  but she's taken very good care of her dolls 
	put this away in the box 
	she wanted to feed the dog 
	where has she learned to do that 
	nobody that we know has  pets  but she may have seen sometimes Maura  she came up the other day with  two kittens 
	the doggie needs his hair combed 
	yeah  go find his house 
	she was into the books  are there certain books that are more interesting to her 
	I don't think so 
	but she does pull the books outof the bookcase  and reads them to herself 
	no  she looks at the  she likes reading the telephone book 
	she picked up a bible one day and said 
	 Jesus 
	very interesting 
	but with her own little books  picture books  
	 you asked what color the apple was  and she answered 
	 apple 
	 sometimes she comes out with the right answer 
	I don't know whether it's a lucky guess or  whether she really understands  but if I say 
	 what color's this 
	she'll say blue  green  red or yellow  and alotof times  it's right 
	you were trying to get her to match colors 
	you told her the orange was the same color as her shirt and the house  do you think she can really see that those were the same color 
	probably not 
	she wasn't concentrating on it  so I would say not 
	she wasn't paying  I didn't think she was paying attention to what I was saying 
	I think she was thinking 
	 I don't think I would ask her what color this orange is  I'd start out with the primary colors 
	Lena is that blue 
	yes 
	what color's mommy's dress 
	byu	see  I'm not sure she really knows but she knows colors  and when I say what color is it  she will answer with a color 
	 she was very careful to delineate boy and girl 
	do you have any idea what criteria she uses 
	I know 
	she said 
	 that's a girl 
	and I would have said it's a boy 
	but  I noticed that the hair was curly  maybe that's 
	does she do that with real kids 
	 she does it a lot faster sometimes than I do 
	she seems to be right  I mean  I'll look 
	 is that a boy or a girl 
	and she'll say 
	 that's a boy 
	and I'll look closely  and say  
	 right it is a boy 
	I would like to know  what she  I  I'm looking at too many things  and she may be looking just at the way a boy walks and a girl walks 
	xxx 
	I can't think 
	we're going into winter and she has a jacket with a zipper 
	this sweater has a zipper in the back 
	so she's never  I can't think of anything that she's owned recently that has had a zipper 
	so  I couldn't tell you or not up or down is easy 
	she had a pretty good grasp on it  but didn't know how  to exert the pressure to get it up or down 
	when you showed her the snap  and asked her what it was she said 
	 it's broken 
	she was very good with food names 
	 and the ice cream I put in the mugs they've had their milk in 
	talks about 
	 this is for me 
	exchange 
	no 
	she really knows 
	she really uses it correctly 
	she says  
	 this is  his  this is  Jeff's  this is mine  this is Lena's 
	she knows 
	are there some things she's beginning to get territorial about 
	her dollies 
	the other things are things nobody else would want anyway 
	her slippers  her nightgown  her clothes  her room 
	she's very good about sharing 
	much better  as I noticed  at her birthday party  than other kids her age 
	the concept seems to be deep and  she's willing 
	www 
	the thing that occurred to me  is the whale had blue  around it  it looked to me to be waves  but 
	I looked again  and I thought 
	 maybe you could think it was clouds 
	you hadta name the mouse and turtle 
	does she know them or were they bad pictures 
	 no  she knew  turtle  she didn't know the mouse  and I think it's because it didn't look very much 
	like a mouse 
	I have a note here that's sort of cryptic 
	you asked her if she could build a tower  and she said 
	 meow 
	oh  yeah 
	I said  did you wanna match it  match it  or something 
	I give up 
	noise is unbearable 
	 she seems to know two  in fact  she's three  because I can remember her saying that 
	 Maura has a doll house 
	but she's talked a lot about a big house 
	the big house 
	there's my house when we drive past it 
	that's my house 
	 and she's been playing with the bigger  Lego blocks
