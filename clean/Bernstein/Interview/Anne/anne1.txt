	she was real good at knowing all the names on the dapper Dan 
	she calls all fat  we have several Hupty Dumpty's and she calls all fat  stuffed toys Humpty Dumpty 
	I noticed  I noticed there's an  several other play areas where we are  an she calls them all Humpty Dumpty 
	I don't know why  laughs 
	it's a familiar  familiar character  I guess 
	 she seemed to know the difference between buttons and snaps 
	yeah  she knows buttons and snaps 
	she can't do them 
	she can't do them  but she knows when we do them 
	she can't motor do them 
	but she recognizes the difference between all of them 
	I think so 
	snaps is odd  except that all baby  -uh  -uh  t-shirts have snaps on  so they're introduced to snaps very early 
	you'd think that zippers would be easier to manipulate 
	no they're not 
	they're two-handed 
	I mean  you hafta hold one  and pull with the other 
	who are you calling really 
	you never call mommy 
	who are ya calling 
	hello 
	we don't have this kind of telephone  yeah  they're all dials 
	that's a nice one  isn't it 
	 hello 
	hello 
	ding  ding  ding  stop playing with the phone 
	put the phone back 
	hello 
	this makes a sound 
	yeah  usually we call daddy 
	d√¶	is daddy there 
	but she uses the real phone  she'll talk to him on the  phone  regular phone  so 
	bau	byebye 
	can ya put it back 
	a	she calls the dog puppy 
	do you have a dog at home 
	no 
	my sister  my sister lives in the same house with us 
	daudi	daddy home 
	no  he went to work 
	does she use doggie and puppy interchangeably 
	helo	yeah  and puppydogs  no difference  same word 
	I was noticing  in fact  thinking about this yesterday  quite a few words she says like that  kitty cat is a kitty cat   but we looked at fish yesterday  in a tank  uh she  the big fish were  big fish and the small fish were baby fish 
	so  she seems to make a distinction on  the size 
	-um  but not with dogs 
	she thought the dragon was a birdie 
	yeah 
	originally 
	 except that we have a book that has a dragon in it 
	so  she knows a dragon 
	you know that's why I was a little surprised  frankly 
	I frankly was surprised that she didn't know that that was a dragon  but it's not  -um  it's not really representtative  you know  it's not long   -um  which the dragon we know in the book is 
	she has alotof out  and in  and up  and down sort of words 
	this is a nice toy  I've never seen this one before 
	she hasn't been to a zoo yet  so she doesn't understand what those things are 
	she's tried puppets at home she's a little afraid of it  though 
	but  -um  she knows  she knows what puppets  we have lotsof puppets 
	she's also  watching the muppets on television  my husband  for some reason  tells them that they're puppets  -um so I thought she would know  what puppet was  -um  because she uses puppets  she'll put them on her hand 
	she seems to know the difference between toy and not toy 
	I hope 
	yeah  I hope she does 
	because stereos and televisions  oh  aren't toys 
	so she doesn't play with them  although she does play with them  it obviously doesn't work  but  I think it's important that she know that some things aren't for her to fool with 
	this is Nan's  this is Nan's  it's not Annie's  and it's not a toy 
	Nan's 
	right 
	she thought that the cow was a puppy 
	yeah  alotof things are horses  words  animals that she's not familiar with  mules  zebras  sheep  are horses  um dogs are kind of a general one  for anything else that's left  laughing 
	has she ever seen a cow  
	no  but we have a  yeah  she's seen lotsof pictures of cows  and we have a stuffed cow  but she never has m understood cows or sheep 
	let's get down  alright 
	let's get down 
	you didn't even see this bunny 
	what's that 
	mousie it's not a mousie  it's a bunny 
	I'm reminded of a  handicapped CP girl that I worked with for  summers  and they tested her down at Canton school with a word association test 
	and  -um  she said the words that were appropriate  to her environment  which were inappropriate to the answers of the test 
	and  -uh  I think that's what happens with a kid 
	that's why the mother can  can -uh  interpret what she's saying  because they know  from whence it comes 
	my husband hates cats  and every time he sees one  he goes 
	 rat 
	it's obviously working  but I think it's getting her a bit confused 
	are there toys that seem to make her talk more 
	obviously  the books make her talk less 
	do you use books for that activity 
	yeah  yeah  we have lotsof books  she doesn't use books at this time of day usually 
	it's usually at a quieter ti you know  when I'm trying to get her to  quiet down before  resting  and stuff   we'll  sit and look at a book 
	but it's hard for  someone her age to sit  anyway
