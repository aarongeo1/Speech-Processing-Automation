	I was afraid to hold her off  because we're going away on Friday  for vacation and I  hated to delay you 
	she calls people up 
	does she have any special routines 
	it's always hello   the person's name  and then oftentimes she has quite long conversations but she always has  she often has them on the real telephone 
	I mean  she gets a response 
	do you think she talks more on the real or the play phone 
	no  on the fake 
	or  on the real one when there's no one on the other end 
	does she have particular people that she picks to -um 
	call 
	yeah  her father  -um  and then Mark and Christopher  who are her cousins 
	always 
	she wanted to put the dragon in the high chair 
	the dragon 
	oh 
	 She puts everything up  in hu  do You mean in human things 
	everything goes every place 
	but she'll try to make the toys do human things 
	oh  yes 
	always 
	she usually reads to the toys 
	the toys don't usually take um can't usually do anything  that's why I was surprised that she wanted him to talk on the microphone  But we have been trying to take turns  so maybe she figured  The Raggedy Ann seems to be her favorite 
	can you put everything into the box for us 
	she thought the spoon was a kite 
	no  the steam coming outof the  the steam coming outof the cereal looked like a kite to her 
	the kite tail 
	then you told her it was steam and that meant it was hot does she know that 
	she knows about steam because we  she oftentimes will   in real steam   she knows what real steam looks like 
	but I'm not sure she's ever seen steam in a book 
	because lotsof times  things are too hot  and the stock phrase is 
	 I'm going to separate this with my spoon to let the steam out 
	is the phrase 
	so she knows what steam is 
	you were pointing out alotof trucks to her 
	-um  we've seen all of them 
	but she doesn't use the words for them 
	she only knows fire engine and truck 
	the dump truck she knows 
	but not a crane 
	she's not especially interested  laughs 
	 Yeah alotof kids do  but she doesn't seem to be very interested 
	and she was confused about the snowman 
	cow's on the next page 
	I don't know 
	I'm surprised she doesn't know snowman  but I guess she doesn't remember from last year 
	I know  for a fact that when  my brother in-law babysat for her they read a snowman book 
	so I was a little surprised she didn't know what that was 
	I think sometimes she has trouble  it useta be  she knew everything in the books  but when she saw them in real life  she didn't  connect  the book thing to the real life thing 
	now  it seems like  if she's seen it in real life  she has a much easier time recognizing it in a book 
	I don't think she's ever seen a snowman  a real snowman  I know  well  cow's on the next page 
	she wanted the boy to sit on her lap  wanted to sit on the boy's lap what is this about sitting on laps 
	she's back into sitting on laps 
	it's just a routine 
	she's -uh  kind of regressing  I don't know what you call it 
	she  I think she's going through a stage  although I don't know much about  stage 
	I don't know anything about stages in children yet 
	but she's getting quite um difficult to separate from me  which is too bad  because  she's gonna be going to nursery school  for a couple of days a week 
	 the lunch box   her nephew got a lunch box 
	and we keep telling her that when she goes to school she can have one 
	She's quite  she loved that lunch box 
	she's been  a couple of times to try her out 
	 she understood that Marco was going on some sort of vacation 
	yeah  she understands them 
	talked about them before  I was hoping that she would talk about it because she has talked about it 
	also  I wanted her to get useta the fact that she's not going to see him for a couple of weeks  laughs 
	because she really is attached to this Marco  beyond belief 
	yeah  a cousin who abuses her terribly  laughs 
	she understands going on a boat  I think she understands fishing  I mean  we've done it 
	she has had a fishing pole  and 
	well  she's had someone else's fishing pole  they play on the beach  as opposed to eating sand last year 
	 Play in the waves  you know 
	make castles in the sand  all the things that children do  Finally 
	is she into building 
	she tried to build with blocks 
	-um  not a lot 
	she builds with blocks  but 
	not  creatively 
	mostly it's 
	what would you say is creative 
	-um  she doesn't make bridges  she stacks 
	you asked her at one point how many blocks there were 
	she's not counting much these days 
	although she was the last time she was here  I remember  She doesn't care 
	does she ask 
	 how many 
	that's something you do with her 
	no  I don't think she asks how many usually 
	oh  she'll pretend sometimes to be counting  if there's a bunch  but 
	and she'll always go by rote one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten 
	but  um I don't think she's connecting them 
	she was having some trouble with the buttons 
	yeah  she's 
	what did you tell her 
	slide it through the hole  laughs 
	does that seem to help her  when you give verbal instructions 
	usually 
	but I was showing her aswell 
	and then she was doing the zipper that she remembered the name of 
	she wanted to  well  she wanted to undress him  and she zipped it up 
	at one point  she called the doll Marco  and you said  Oh is that the doll's name 
	does she name her dolls 
	-uh  yes 
	they have some names 
	some of them have names 
	one is dolly 
	that's the dolls' name  Dolly  I figured  -um  and one is Raggedy 
	because it's Raggedy Ann 
	and then you talked about going to the doctor  and she said 
	 is he going to fix my thumb 
	she had a thumb operation 
	she wanted to know if he was going to fix Peter's thumb 
	now she thinks that everyone who goes to the doctor  she had an opera  a thumb operation 
	now she thinks that everyone who's going to the doctor is going to have a thumb operation   she said it a couple of times this week because people have been going to the doctor's because everyone we know has been sick 
	she must think people have strange thumbs  laughs 
	 she wasn't very interested in the vocabulary book 
	yeah  she wasn't 
	I'm surprised 
	I  I think she's not paying much attention today 
	but  I'm not going to make excuses  sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn't 
	she's not super  she doesn't sit and listen to books as much as some children I know 
	the only thing she pointed out spontaneously  I think  was the turtle on the blocks 
	you mean my asking 
	 what is that 
	what was the discussion about something sitting on the turtle 
	sure 
	she went to the dentist a couple of weeks ago  with us  and  you know  she went to sit in the chair  and all that kind of stuff  and at the dentist's office there's a crocodile that has a  you may not have known this because I didn't  I  it completely eluded me in a book that we have  Birds  apparently  clean crocodiles' teeth   so you oftentimes see a crocodile  with a bird on his head 
	it's kind of like a  symbiotic relationship 
	we have a book called crocodile tears  which she's always enjoyed  and it has a picture of  how rude the crocodile is because he had a little bird come and pick his teeth and  it always eluded me prior to this thing  so when I saw the bird sitting on top of the turtle  it just cracked me up 
	it didn't crack her up 
	but it cracked me up  because it looked like  looked like  you know  the bird was going to be picking the t  the turtle's teeth 
	ofcourse  the turtle doesn't have any teeth  laughs
