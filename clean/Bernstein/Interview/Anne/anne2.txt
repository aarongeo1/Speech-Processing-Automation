	she doesn't under stand that concept 
	 does she really understand the concept of counting 
	um to three at least  um she only skips five  so  number five   So I'm  consistently skips number five  laughs 
	did she learn to count herself  or is it something you 
	she started the routine  because I  haven't been doing any of that  and we were really surprised  so ofcourse  we started counting with her 
	I think she really start counting because in the gym  we um she takes a gym class  and she goes one  two  three  jump 
	they  all do that 
	is it the gym class that's taught her words like turn around  and 
	 on my knees 
	I don't think so 
	I don't think so 
	they just have that one routine 
	where does she get words like on my lap and turn around  an 
	 the other side 
	well  on my lap I guess because we have a baby next store  so she has alotof those  like I'm xxx 
	because she speaks in a high voice  to a baby 
	and she speaks  I mean  I don't remember speaking in a high voice to her  but  we speak in a high voice to the baby  and so  she does 
	and  -um  she goes through that whole routine with the baby thing  and where she's playing mother  -um  to the point where she was nursing a baby last week 
	-um  and we  we were really amused 
	I think the word lap	 does she do alotof that 
	 other side 
	 turn around 
	stuff  that's very sophisticated 
	I don't know 
	see  I don't  I don't think that we teach her anything 
	but  you know  except by  what we say 
	she's in day care  right 
	no  no 
	she wouldn't accept the boy sitting just any old way 
	on his knees  yeah 
	she was much more sophisticated about the little boy doll for instance  this time she calls it a little boy 
	yeah  instead of Humpty Dumpty 
	 Yeah  she really does know 
	if that had been a girl doll 
	yes  by hair 
	not by any sex parts  although she knows there's a big difference  because she plays with boys most of the time 
	 with the blocks  she used the boy as an agent  Does she use her toys to do things for her 
	she uses me to do things for her  usually 
	it's usually Mommy	um she still used me 
	does she have blocks at home that she plays with 
	-um  smaller ones 
	just started to play with blocks 
	she's not that 
	she had some sophisticated ideas about what to do with them  she wanted to stack them into towers and build bridges  does she do that with hers 
	um I initiated the bridge concept  and she still doesn't do that herself 
	but  won't make a bridge herself 
	-um  she'll make a tower  she knows what a bridge is  like she goes under a bridge  legs make a bridge 
	so she knows the concept of a bridge  but  she's not  I don't think she's that  manually dextrous 
	mommy all done 
	no  I'm not done yet 
	she wanted to take pants off and zipper  and change diapers 
	does she try to do that with her dolls 
	-uh  no 
	I don't like that toy 
	we have  we just have baby dolls 
	does she do any of that stuff on her own clothing 
	yes 
	and Michael's 
	she wants to zip and unzip my pants and my  belt 
	um she doesn't have a lot  you know  she doesn't have belts 
	shoelaces  and 
	yeah  -uh  she's trying to do shoes now 
	but she  um can't do them yet 
	she can't tie  obviously  but can she untie 
	she doesn't try to untie 
	she knew every picture in the book 
	yeah 
	easily 
	I was amazed 
	there are pictures in that book I have a hard time with 
	she doesn't have that book at home  so its that she understands  the concepts for all those words now 
	she's very good interaction wise with you 
	things like 
	 it's Annie's turn 
	 the boy's turn 
	 he do it now 
	laughs Now has become a big word 
	she gets on the phone and says 
	 Daddy  come home now 
	 yeah  well  we're trying to share  now  because she has lotsof people to share with 
	she's entered that stage when everything is 
	 mine 
	 when she says 
	 Annie's turn 
	does she really 
	yeah 
	yes 
	but she would never say it's Mike's turn  laughs 
	but she said it was Mommy's turn 
	yeah  well  she likes to play with me 
	she also used comparatives  
	 sit down like Annie 
	yeah 
	yeah  alotof 
	 like me 
	 like Annie does 
	like she wants to be like someone else is 
	 if someone's bigger 
	so  like 
	 mommy does 
	www 
	again  again  again  again 
	she likes to really repeat -uh  like songs  I mean  we'll sing the same song ten times 
	and she asks for help now 
	right 
	does she help other kids 
	um a very small baby  like she'll help Peter  my nephew's -um  seven months  she helps him do everything  I mean  much too  too vigorously  laughs 
	but no one her  own size  she's really not  sharing very well 
	I don't  think 
	she was very into opening it and closing it  Is she into investigating at home 
	yes 
	yes  and turns everything on  and it's getting difficult  like around the stove  opens every door  takes out every  thing and leaves it all over the  the you know  floors  she's very  into  a huge array of things around her 
	does she then put it back  
	that's one of the phrases that she talks about 
	well  we try 
	 Yes 
	she'll put one thing back 
	she likes things in their place 
	if its something like a coat  she always insists that I hang it up 
	but when it's all her toys all over the floor  she's not the slightest bit interested in putting things back  laughs 
	she had other interesting concepts 
	at one point she said to you 
	 this is too heavy 
	you were taken aback by that one 
	where do you think she grabs terms like that 
	well  because lotsof times I'll tell her that something 
	for instance  we've been putting in a garden 
	I'll tell her that the wheelbarrow is too heavy for her 
	but she insists on trying it anyway 
	um proving to herself that she can't carry groceries in the house  those kinds of things 
	she remembered the dragon 
	you know  I  I almost mentioned it to her this morning  and then I thought you'd have different toys  so I didn't bother 
	so  -um  I was surprised 
	does she have boy dolls and girl dolls at home 
	-um  I don't know what she thinks some of them are 
	I  I mean  most of them are neuter 
	except the obvious little girl dolls 
	well  the Humpty Dumpty's I think she considers as boys 
	what's the date today 
	she'll be twenty months tomorrow 
	that big sound after the elephant is my husband makes a huge sound  elephant sound that she tries to imitate  laughs
