	I don't think she  would ever say something  I think if she sees an apple on her  the tray of her highchair she'll say apple  but I don't think she  laughs would say it if she saw one in a book 
	and I don't think she knows a shoe in a book as she does a shoe on her foot 
	she's not really into reading books 
	ah  apparently not 
	she loves them  and she loves to sit and look at them  but I don't think 
	she seemed to know the Pat the bunny book 
	I don't  I don't know where she  we don't have it  so don't know where she learned 
	and  she seemed to know right away to turn to the page with daddy's scratchy face 
	and she knew  she patted the bunny  which surprised me  but we don't have that book 
	it's possible  just because everybody has it  that she's seen it some place else 
	does she have blocks at home 
	she does 
	she has  um a set of about fifty little blocks  and while I was working  one of my babysitters would build towers for her  and as far as I knew  she would knock over the towers  and the babysitter would build towers she'd knock over  and then  a few weeks ago  we were playing at someone else's house  and she went to the blocks and started building incredible towers 
	herself 
	and that  so that's something new that she xxx 
	the shoes seemed to be some sort of an attraction  they're new  right 
	they're not 
	she has gotten this thing about shoes in the last few weeks  and she just  takes everybody's shoes and puts them on her feet and walks around the house  to the point where we were in a store the other day and she walked up to a strange woman and untied her shoes 
	and started taking them off  laughs 
	how do ya like that 
	 and she knows about socks 
	has she said the word sock 
	-um hm 
	these things all look so different  I mean  my shoes and socks look nothing like hers 
	she has been around  no less than six or eight people a day for the last two weeks   and she'd always get the right shoes back to the right person 
	www 
	there wasn't too much in there that  looked familiar to me 
	from her experience 
	were there any that did 
	well  I think the milk she was saying milk at lunch today 
	put these way in the box 
	well  she knows keys  but I don't know if she knows the word 
	and I think alotof those things  apple that she would eat an apple  but other than 
	well  she does call it  she does say apple 
	but I think it's generally for applesauce 
	she knew egg 
	she  I think she does  because when I say egg  she comes running 
	she loves eggs 
	and  but I 
	didn't she say egg 
	it sounded like it 
	but lately she has repeated almost every word we say  so you don't really know if she knew it before  or she's just  repeating the sounds 
	she's got a kissing routine 
	oh  she kisses a lot 
	she kisses things more than people 
	she'll kiss dogs and  and toys and things  she's not big at kissing people 
	does it make things better  
	no watch  Kay 
	she likes watches 
	who is this kid Scott 
	Scott is well  her nephew  who she has just been in love with for two weeks 
	and she says  Scott about every other word outof her mouth has been Scott 
	would she play on the telephone if he were on the other end 
	we haven't had our telephone with us  while we've been away  so  she hasn't seen a telephone to play with for a long time 
	so  I haven't played with a telephone with her for over two months  so  I don't know 
	she seemed to sort of know what to do with it 
	yeah  but this  as I said before  this one is different from ours 
	anyhow  so I think she was just 
	yours is 
	a dial 
	she knew some things about the cage  the door  you called it a cage  she understands that 
	no 
	I don't think she would know what a cage is 
	has she seen one 
	maybe  a cat's cage  we have a cage for our cat 
	but I don't know if she's really seen it 
	you showed her how she could work the puppet  put her hand in it 
	do you think that she understood 
	well  she has a puppet that  we've been surprised that she doesn't put her hand in it 
	she doesn't know how to work it  but she likes to put her hand in it 
	and kind of wave it around 
	can she name body parts 
	don't think so 
	she knows alotof them  but I don't think she knows  doesn't say them 
	I know she knows  I know she knows nose  and mouth  and eyes  and I think she knows leg and I think she knows foot 
	about the hair brush 
	yeah  that's one of her best toys 
	does she brush her own hair  or others 
	everyone's 
	her own and other people's 
	oh  she brushes our cat  much to his dismay 
	does she handle it well 
	very well  I think 
	I am surprised that she  brushes her own hair pretty well 
	www 
	do you think she knows that that abstract little thing is a house 
	no 
	does she use the term 
	I think that when some people play with blocks with her  they say they're gonna build a house 
	so  she would say the word house  but I don't think she knew what it was 
	just meant I'm gonna do blocks 
	you asked her to smell the flowers in the Pat the bunny book  do you have flowers in the backyard that she's smelled 
	she knows what flowers are 
	we  have been going all summer to kind of a wild place in Maine where there were lotsof wild flowers 
	and my mother picked her one flower one day  and since then she will not go outof the door  if she sees a flower  request grunts until she gets a flower 
	and she never goes outside without handfuls of flowers 
	does she smell them 
	she smells them  other people smell them 
	in fact  she wanted to pick the flowers in the nice little arrangements on the way in here 
	you asked her what her name was 
	I ask her that about five times a day 
	and she doesn't have an answer 
	do you think she understands what a name is 
	I think she does 
	I think she's just playing with me  she won't say it 
	does she umderstand  understand other people's names 
	she knows my name's mommy and daddy's name is dada 
	does she give the pets  
	not really  because 
	  starts crying
