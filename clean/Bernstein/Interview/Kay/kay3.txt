	she decided it's time to go home 
	do you think it's possible to get her back here for one more session 
	yes  but the reason that I called you now is because we're going away for a rather long vacation  so  about six weeks  yeah  that's why I hadta do it this week  and that's why I was so nervous when I couldn't find you 
	 is she into books more now 
	mm  pretty  about  fifty fifty books with everything else 
	all of her toys as compared to books  she'll play with half the time 
	does she have any particular favorite book 
	no 
	no 
	she prefers  I think  just the structure of hard books rather than 
	you have cookies down here  honey 
	look at all these 
	 if you're sitting down  will she tend to pick up one that she prefers more than the others 
	I don't think so  I don't think 
	 she likes to do  the Judy and Paul book  does she have that book at home 
	she doesn't 
	and I don't know  and she did that last time too  and to my knowledge she had never seen the book before 
	does she understand the concept of smelling flowers 
	-um hm 
	she likes to smell flowers 
	and does she try things like putting her finger through little holes 
	yes 
	in her head 
	but she's never had practice with  putting her finger through mommy's ring 
	yes 
	she plays with our rings and watches and  jewelry a lot  so 
	I can't remember if she's the child who always kisses everything  is that a game that you play with her 
	she  hugs things a lot  and I don't know where she got that either  she  when she first started getting interested in  dolls and animals and  she  the first thing she does is hugs 
	them and  oh 
	I guess we must have done it 
	we do so many things unconsciously that  we don't find out until they start doing  what you do 
	she knew the names of a bunch of animals today 
	she has  a monkey that's a puppet 
	that's why she was calling that a monkey 
	because that's the only   that's right  that's the only puppet she knows 
	xxx  
	so she thought that was a  all puppets are monkey's I guess 
	but she could say duck and doggie 
	yeah  we have a book with those in  so she knows   I guess old MacDonald 
	what's her repertoire right now 
	that's about the  the limit 
	um she knows birdies 
	she's very good at imitating  and you often say 
	 can you say this 
	 do you do that at home a lot 
	-um hm 
	and she says it 
	usually  if she's in the right mood  she'll repeat whatever  whatever I say 
	are there any times when you especially like to do that with her 
	not really 
	just whenever I  have time 
	do you do it to get a word out the first time  or do you also do it when she comes out with something and you don't like the way it sounds 
	-um  I found that  when I want her to learn a word I say  
	 can you say something 
	but after she's started saying  calling something by a  word  I tend to repeat it the right way  if she says  Gramps she says  and I say  oh  Gramps 
	then she'll say  daemps again 
	she was into the dog  you have a dog 
	no  we have a cat 
	does she understand the concept of 
	 house 
	her own is very big 
	does she have any doll house  or 
	no  but she knows about other people's houses 
	she knows where  her friends live  we walk down the street  she knows precisely who lives in which house  and what she can find when she gets in there 
	and  she knows her own  house  she knows her grandmother's house  and  -uh  so I  but I don't know about little houses  I don't think she 
	she didn't say brush  but you seemed to feel that she knew it 
	she plays a lot with my hair brush 
	she has a new little toy that she plays with all my hair things  my bobby pins and barrettes and hairbrush  and yesterday I said either 
	 go get the hairbrush 
	because she'd carried it away from me  or 
	 what is this 
	and she said something that sounded like hairbrush 
	so  I know she knows the word and  I think she said it yesterday 
	can she do her own hair 
	she can   she does 
	she brushes her own hair in one direction or another  not 
	not into the blocks 
	she likes her blocks 
	but they're a little smaller  and more  more interesting  I think 
	there's lotsof them in there 
	easier to build higher things with 
	what does she tend to do with them 
	put one on top of the other  on top of the other  on top of the other  and then go boom  
	  she liked to take things in and outof the cage does she tend to like to take things in and out  
	yes  she has uh she  I don't know why  but I allowed her to use the kitchen cabinet doors  and drawers 
	and she has one book that is like this book 
	I think it's made by the same people 
	and it has doors that you open 
	and it has animals 
	and then they go to bed 
	and you open the door and see them sleeping 
	and she loves that  with each little door 
	 she takes things in and out 
	yes  and she has been for a long time 
	that's one of the ways that we keep her busy 
	little things in things 
	 you asked her to show you the eyes  and she didn't do that  does she know her own eyes 
	she does 
	yes 
	to Kay Kay 
	do you know where your eyes are 
	she knows her eyes and her ears 
	she'll point towards  we worry about her eyes  says 
	 eyes 
	and she knows ears and mouth and nose  and toes  nose is her favorite 
	nose 
	www 
	no 
	I don't think she knows either 
	she said man yesterday  but that's the first sex difference 
	do you think that's because she doesn't find them useful 
	I think  yeah  I don't think there is much  difference for her right now 
	she was real big on the breakfast foods 
	and her favorite thing is raisin Bran and she just  as you can see  breakfast food is her 
	can she drink on her own 
	yeah 
	does she have favorite things 
	no  she just likes to drink 
	she'll just drink water  and just drink it 
	she likes glasses and cups 
	 juice is anything liquid 
	will she call milk juice then  
	she calls everything juice  water  grape juice and milk are all juice 
	anything liquid is juice 
	www 
	 no  she has her own  but it's a regular bowl
