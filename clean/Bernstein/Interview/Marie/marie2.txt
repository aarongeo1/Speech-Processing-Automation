	she has many more words 
	many more than before 
	was it six weeks ago  that we were here 
	so like  she's re second 
	she's come a long way in terms of building vocabulary 
	she knew some words that she was using  like her pants and her shoes  sneakers 
	generally  what would you say she knows in that domain 
	clothing 
	um diapers  -um 
	she knows you know  everything that she  suits  bathing suits  I bought her a new ba  bathing suit and then  a couple of suits  and I just said suit	 suit  suit 
	ya wanna bottle  okay 
	ba	and then  let's see  hat  she knows  um it hasn't been warm  so she hasn't been wearing sweaters  or things like that 
	an she knows terms like tops and pants instead of dress  I guess 
	oh  yeah 
	a dress 
	she hardly ever wears  a dress  though 
	-um  a couple of times she has  she knows dress 
	you distinguished for her pants and jeans 
	does she call them one or the other 
	no 
	jeans is a word that she  well  she has used jeans  because she says ginz	you talked about tying and untying the shoes  and again  you distinguished between shoes and sneakers  does she play around with her shoelaces 
	no  not usually 
	I just  I have hard time getting her to sit  you know  to tie her shoes so I sort of like to  I guess we talked about this last time  her to know with the doll that  she needs to have her shoes tied  that that's what the ties are for 
	 can she tell the difference between shoes and sneakers 
	yeah  she can 
	I think  I think she knows that  though  that the same word means both 
	things  she usually calls  she usually calls those  sneakers  shoes 
	but um when I say sneaks	 sneaks 
	you said 
	 just like yours 
	she looked 
	she understands then 
	just like yours  yeah 
	with the dragon you got a bit simpler  because instead of calling it a cage  you called it a box 
	a box 
	I did that again  I did that last time 
	no she still hasn't been to a zoo to see cages 
	she has  um been to a zoo 
	and she has seen cages  once 
	she has  but  she was sort of  frightened  -um  more than anything about the animals being in the cage 
	and she associated these bars with her crib  because she said he went nightnight  
	so  -um  I didn't feel like I wanted to confuse it any more  with the cage  because I don't want her to think that her crib is a cage 
	so  -um  I think that's probably why I didn't push it with the cage 
	there was this long discussion you had with her about 
	 keys for the door 
	keys for the car  does she fool around with keys alotof kids do 
	yeah  she does 
	she does 
	an she knows  um she said that before  that whole  a segment  of association  with the keys  and she has one for the beach   too 
	um I don't know if other kids do this  but  and you just hafta mention one thing  and she then will go  remember  -um  everything that she knows about  about the beach  or about keys 
	some kids call them car keys right away 
	she was cute with the dragon  sticking her tongue out 
	do you play funny games like that with her 
	yeah  we do when we have the time we try  I think sometimes that we get too serious about doing our work and stuff  but  at least once a day  especially before she goes to bed or something  her father does a lot  play funny games like that with her 
	does she have any puppets at home 
	did I ask you that the last time 
	will she put her hand in it 
	yup 
	she will 
	this is a little different  though  but she did put  was able to put her hand in this and make it move 
	this time 
	she's got the term toys	I know exactly why that is 
	it's because  she bugs me at home when I'm in the kitchen  and I've had  more of a separation um of her toys 
	that dragon doesn't come out  honey 
	her toys are in her room  or the living room  and they're not  in the kitchen  unless she drags them into the kitchen and they don't stay there very long 
	and if I'm doing something in the kitchen  and I wanna have some time to myself  I will say to her 
	 go and play with your toys 
	in your room' and she'll say toys	she was very big on the chairs 
	does she have her own chair  
	um no 
	but she is  fascinated with the chairs 
	she climbs up and down onto the kitchen chairs  and highchairs all the time  I guess it's just  maybe  meets her activity needs 
	something 
	she said 
	 eat  eat 
	she obviously associates them with 
	eating  sitting in the chairs to eat 
	yeah  that's right 
	buk	books  right 
	she obviously has alotof stuff in the the Pat the bunny book 
	yeah  she has that book at home 
	you were trying to get her to distinguish the boy from the girl and she was having trouble with that 
	you know  it's  it's funny 
	I thought that she definitely knew  that Paul was Paul  or  and Judy was Judy 
	because for a long time  she's been calling them by their names 
	and  doing it quite consistently 
	except today  she confused them  so 
	but you were trying to point out to her that one was a boy  and one was a girl  not that one was Paul and one was Judy 
	that one was a boy  and one was a girl 
	well  I think that  because she's still  she still calls all girls boys 
	so  in the beginning  all children were boys 
	and now  they're either boys or girls  depending on I don't know what 
	I've got something for her to eat 
	now  I think she is calling  when she sees a girl sometimes  she calls it a boy  and  um more often than a boy called a girl 
	it's hard I don't think she really distinguishes them 
	she likes to read  apparently  and she had alotof words in the vocabulary book  for instance  she knew the word comb 
	does she use one 
	a comb 
	no  I use a comb  though 
	and so she knows that I do  and the brush  although I  use a brush for her hair  not that often  she doesn't  know a brush  I didn't think she knew the brush 
	she knew the eggs 
	yup 
	does she eat those 
	no  uhuh 
	but she knows what they are 
	well  actually  I useta use eggs  she does eat eggs  I guess I should say  she  -um  sees them in the refrigerator  and she knows she's not to touch them  because they can break 
	so I use them in cooking 
	you have a back yard right 
	-um  a small one that she never really plays in 
	she was talking about picking flowers  smelling flowers 
	-um  at her grandmother's house  every time we go there  she has flowers and she has Marie pick them 
	for mummie 
	does she like to pick the flowers 
	oh  yeah 
	she likes to pick anything 
	if we go in the store  she likes to pick leaves off bushes 
	 she talked about patting them and later  about patting the bunny 
	patting  for her is  well  if she's not sposta touch something to hurt it  because she was patting the tape 
	I said not to touch the tape  because we don't wanna take it off and I might have said 
	 Pat it 
	or something 
	she said 
	 Pat 
	and she kissed it 
	and she kissed it 
	and then pat it 
	so that's another constellation of  of  um behavior that she has that -um  when she's to be nice  and that comes from when she was starting to hit  children 
	and children were beginning to hit her 
	the learning not to hit  to be nice  and that involves kissing and patting 
	she didn't do much with the blocks today  she was most successful at lining them up on the floor 
	no  she usually makes a tower 
	I think she was  she was clapping for herself when she made a tower 
	like that she  she felt that she was successful at that 
	the lining on the floor  is just something that I did  and I don't um I think she saw that that was something I did  and that's another thing you can do with them 
	but I was having a hard time trying to think what we could do with them  other than 
	 you talked about things in the past  going for a walk  swings  do you think that she remembers from day to day  
	I think she do  I think she does 
	because I'm   since I've been working  I worked yesterday  and I didn't see her 
	and  I often ask her   what she's done  the day before 
	and  she can tell me  you know  pretty truthfully  and yesterday she did go with Susy for swings 
	but  it's not sophisticated 
	it's just  it's usually common activities  but she's told me  some 
	she went with Suzy or Annie for a walk 
	the walking thing was just in general 
	what does she do 
	when she walks  she holds hands 
	with the other babies in her play group
