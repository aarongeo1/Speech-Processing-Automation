	lately  she's been drawing on things 
	everything 
	including jackets  coats  walls  floors  couches  and  for the past couple of days  that's kinda been her thing  and  she likes to read books a lot she spends alotof time bringing books to us like -um  they're all over the house  so she  I noticed this morning  if she just sort a  of walks and sees one  she'll pick one up and bring it to somebody  and wants to read books and then   probably  -um the third thing she does alotof is playing  with a ball 
	she seems to have a routine with you when she plays with the ball 
	she'll do predictable things 
	yeah  well  I let her play by herself  -um like today  she gets into  sort of 
	but sometimes it's more  of an interaction  like when she really does throw it back and forth 
	and she catches it 
	yeah 
	she does 
	yeah 
	with a bigger ball  it's easier for her to play  -um you know  for her to catch it  like that 
	she seems to know alotof the items in the room here  she was busy labelling things 
	does she walk around labelling things at home 
	-um let's see 
	mommy wants to put diapers on you 
	I think she does  label things 
	I think  -um yeah  that  she is learning alotof new words  and she'll say  in fact  I noticed that if I say a new word that she's never said before that she will repeat it after me 
	about the puppet  first of all  you've apparently taken her to 
	a zoo  she just went to the zoo yesterday 
	so it's fresh in her mind 
	right 
	and she liked some of those animals 
	she said -um tiger  owl  goose 
	no  she really did see a goose 
	gu	 gu	goose 
	and she's been  
	au	au	au	and she has seen all these  the neat thing about it is she saw them all in the books before she went  and so  we read stories about zoos  and she went and saw them  and then when we came home  we read the books again 
	yeah  sothat  it sort of made it more realistic for her 
	bu	bu	bau	first you told her the dragon was in a cage  and then you told her it was in a 
	box 
	no 
	I noticed that myself 
	-um I think  I thought at the time that I called it a box  which it is a box  that I'm not really sure that  -um although  I was thinking whether or not she's aware that the animals were in a cage  or that this would be like the cages she saw  and she did see cages  -um and cages are a more  sophisticated term for exactly what that is 
	so  it's probably some ambivalence on my part about her understanding 
	she was very much into the box itself 
	does she do alotof playing around with 
	-uh  boxes 
	I think all kids when they see a box 
	are you the mother who indicated that she's an incessant opener and closer of cabinets 
	oh  no  Marie screams 
	I think all kids do  when they see 
	oh  you want that to be opened 
	you know  box  when they get gifts  they enjoy the wrappings and boxes more than the actual toys 
	with the dragon  you were pointing out face parts 
	she definitely did know how to name them 
	do you practice things like that 
	yeah  yeah  we do 
	yeah 
	we did when she was a lot younger  -um when I first realized that  that she could  understand and begin naming things  
	the sort of use of the face  to learn 
	-um  parts of the body 
	she's pretty good now 
	yeah  she's pretty good 
	she's got eyes and 
	well  she knows -um chin  and ears  and  -um tummy 
	things like that 
	and she doesn't say  arms or legs yet 
	she was pretty fascinated with the dragon's tongue 
	puppy 
	got a puppy 
	she wasn't too fond of the telephone  although she played with it somewhat 
	just  yeah  she does have a routine 
	that's funny  like you don't  I think  I'm not really aware of  routines that she has  but she definitely does 
	she goes to the phone  and she'll 
	she'll lift up the  the receiver  and she'll say 
	 byebye 
	byebye  or  hi  hi 
	 and she talked to her meme and pepe  her grandparents on the phone this morning  just this morning 
	and  she is going to see them tonight 
	so  I sort of prepare her for that 
	we're gonna go for the weekend 
	she was not fond of the books 
	this  oh  the books 
	-um  I think she just didn't wanna read books right now 
	she's more  because  books is kind of  like a sitting down relaxing activity  and she's never been here before  and I think she just hadta  run around  that kind of energy  you know 
	and she wasn't into the blocks 
	the blocks 
	no 
	but she does play with blocks at home 
	quite a bit 
	she sort of got into the doll belatedly  she liked the things that she could fool around with on it 
	does she play with her own clothing 
	yeah  not mutilate it  no 
	I meant manipulate 
	some of the other children do that 
	yeah 
	um yes  she does but  I think more mine 
	she's good with the zipper 
	yes  she is 
	she's never done a zipper before 
	first time 
	this is the first time she's ever done a zipper 
	ever 
	that I've ever seen her 
	yeah  she was good for the zipper 
	-um  but  because she nurses  I unbutton  my blouse  usually  and  -um  she'll say 
	 button  button 
	and play with the  my clothes 
	more than I've seen her play with her own  although she probably plays with her own 
	it was cute  because the doll's wearing the same kind of clothes as she is 
	yeah  that's right 
	you were trying to call her attention to the fact that the clothing was just the same 
	do you think she  
	no  I don't think she  -um  paid attention to that 
	does she play with her own shoes 
	yeah  she does 
	I thought  like  I thought it was interesting that  you know  she  won't sit still to allow me to put on her shoes  but that  if  it's sort of nice to have a doll where the child can do it to the doll  and maybe they can understand that that's what you're doing to  but  -um  she wasn't  ready to do that 
	maybe she's not ready for that concept 
	where're ya going  Baba 
	wa	walk 
	 a walk  a walk 
	she wasn't into sitting around  is she more of a runner  
	  Marie screams and fusses 
	Marie  we hafta put your diapers on before we go home 
	look 
	what's under there  
	what's that 
	huh 
	that's you 
	are there times when she's more talkative than others 
	yeah  next time maybe we can come  maybe I'll come in the afternoon 
	because after you'd left and we had arranged for this time  I realized that sometimes  ofcourse it's different 
	 some mothers say that when I'm dressing her  she's talkative 
	when she's getting dressed  no 
	no 
	not getting dressed  Because I don't talk to her that much  when she gets dressed 
	and she's not that talkative  um when she eats  those kind of functions  um but  usually  when her father comes home  late at night  -um  like after supper  or something 
	she gets  um crazy 
	and she just sort of  for about an hour  she talks a lot  about alotof things 
	she wanted to leave at one point  and was distressed to find that the door was beyond her  is she a big door opener and closer 
	yeah  she is 
	yeah  she's um I guess  into doors 
	now 
	she learned how to open the door to our apartment and go out  so I hafta keep it locked  laughs 
	but she always wants to go out
