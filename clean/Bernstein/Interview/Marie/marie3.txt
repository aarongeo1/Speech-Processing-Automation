	ya wanna get outof the chair  Monica 
	no 
	she seemed to be into the phone  although she doesn't say anything into it here is she into it at home 
	she never ss  she ans  actually insists that she talk on the phone whenever anyone calls but  she never says anything but hi	pretty   consistent with what she does  with the real phone 
	she'll just say 
	 hi  hi 
	you said she likes this phone because it rings does it ring differently from her phone at home 
	no  um I think she liked  the ringing  there are some  when she plays with the phone at home  she does play with it  um at other times when there's no one there  and she just goes up over to it  and takes the receiver off the hook and  goes 
	 hi  hi  hi 
	but there's no ringing associated with it  and that was more my suggestion that  the phone  this phone rings 
	but at home  she can't make that phone ring at her will 
	this is very important to leave this on mummie 
	I'm gonna talk to Nan for a couple of more minutes 
	okay 
	she wants to nurse  I think I can probably talk while she nurses 
	do ya wanna nurse 
	huh 
	you hafta leave that on 
	don't touch that  though 
	don't touch 
	it's not touching this 
	it's just that it might be picking up her sucking 
	I don't know if it would or not 
	with all these toys that have insides and outsides like the cage  and the house  she's very much fascinated about taking things out  taking things off  putting things in 
	take it off 
	is she like that at home 
	what sorts of things does she 
	I think that she is 
	um take it  oh  that word  that phrase  she says 
	 take it off 
	or  um she ne  she doesn't usually say 
	 put it in 
	but 
	 take it out 
	take it out 
	I can't think of anything offhand  right now 
	but  like her sweater  something  she'll wanna take it off 
	all of a sudden she'll get an idea that she wants to take it off  and she's just beginning to dress herself  and then she'll  try to put it on  and she'll say 
	  put it on  put it on 
	but she has a little hard time putting it on herself 
	so I'm starting to help her do that 
	um shoes  clothing 
	in general 
	does she try to pull things outof other things 
	yeah  she does  but I can't think  like just her toys 
	actually  I'm probably not  very good  I don't know what she's been doing  at school 
	I guess  she's been going full time for four weeks 
	at school 
	and I have only been here with her  um this week 
	or  two days 
	so  I actually don't have that much idea  in terms of what she spends most of her time doing  during the day 
	she  they do have alotof educational toys there that she's  they said  -um  there's this one toy there with pegs  that they put inside 
	little holes 
	and that she's  spends  an hour  trying to do that 
	and she's able to do it  so  that she is  um fascinated with those kind of toys 
	don't touch 
	just don't touch that 
	okay  you're going to hafta stop nursing if you touch it 
	does she understand the difference between things that are toys and not toys 
	I think she does 
	maybe in more of a negative sense than I'd wanna 
	sometimes it's my own fault because sometimes at home  she will be  um in the way 
	and in the kitchen  and I'll be tripping over her  and say 
	 Marie  go play with your toys 
	 xxx in your room 
	no	 no 
	and  -um  I think she does knows  what are toys an what aren't toys also  because I say  if she's playing with something that she's not sposta be playing with which  could be harmful to her  I might say 
	 that's not a toy 
	 we're not gonna play with that right now 
	although  I'm not consistent because I do let her  play with things that aren't toys  that will not be harmful 
	such as makeup 
	when she was working with the makeup  she seemed to know 
	parts that it goes on  I don't know if it's helped her  um I think it's imitative putting on lipstick and  putting  blush on her cheeks  or something like that  that she sees me do it and my mother do it  and  she's played a lot with my mother's pocketbook that's how she started doing that  and my mother st  showed her how to put it on 
	what parts of her face does she know now 
	I think she's aware of all parts of her face  in fact  um yesterday she learned gums  her gums 
	and and she has words she says 
	for her face 
	 um cheeks  ears  eyes  brows  tongue 
	gums 
	she was very aware of the tongue  as a matter of fact  she decided to call the dragon 
	tongue  the tongue  right 
	does she do that 
	pick out one characteristic 
	 yeah 
	 tongue 
	tongue 
	yeah  there's that tongue in there  huh 
	has she done that with anything else at home 
	let's see  yes 
	my husband's been feeding her in the morning  oatmeal 
	a cereal with some sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and raisins in it  and she  he found that she would eat it for him if he put  she put  she put raisins in it  and she calls that whole dish raisins  just raisins 
	you hadta tell her a lot about the house 
	do you the she would have noticed that that was a house 
	I don't know 
	I don't think so 
	she may have 
	-um  but they don't look that much like houses to me 
	I think that's why I chose to tell her 
	that it was  to just  although ofcourse she could have decided for herself that it was  one thing or another 
	okay  let's go  Marie
