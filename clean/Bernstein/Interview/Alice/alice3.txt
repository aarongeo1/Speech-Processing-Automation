	before  when you had  I think it was butterfly  the next time  it was ladybugs or something  but you called them all bugs 
	is that the way she  the way she handles it 
	-uh  so far  yeah 
	yeah  it was ants  I think  the second time 
	does she know that they are 
	has she ever seen 
	an ant 
	a bug  whatever 
	yeah  yeah  we have in the yard  we point at them and stomp 
	they're carpenter ants  laughs 
	big ants 
	now  can she name them  can she say bug 
	oh  yeah 
	and does she do it appropriately 
	yeah 
	yeah 
	because we've seen butterflies  out in the yard  we call that bug we've seen beetles and called that bug  and ants we call bug 
	this time she named duck again 
	well  she was saying duck and then she started consistently calling them chick  and I didn't correct her because  the  ducks looked enough like chicks that 
	I didn't care 
	right 
	and you're not gonna quibble over things like that 
	no  because  not now  not at this point 
	I think a little bit  later on  I mean  if  if it had looked a little bit mm  more like a duck with a real distinct bill  then I would've  maybe 
	now you did this time call attention to  boys and girls  deliberately 
	do you do that with her now in the real world 
	does she know the difference 
	I don't think she knows the difference 
	she doesn't attempt to say boy and girl 
	well  she was saying boy  she said boy at one point in this book and that's  part of the reason I was saying  some boys and some girls 
	she doesn't say girl 
	-um hm 
	you say good girl  but she doesn't 
	 she doesn't respond 
	now this time you used a bunch of parts of the body with her 
	I thought it was interesting 
	she's definitely got  you used the word hand with her a lot  put your hand in 
	oh  well  I never even thought of naming that 
	she knows that so well  but  we started with  well  the face  and the foot 
	and she knows 
	oh  the tongue  and the teeth and the mouth  and the nose and ear  and eyes  hair 
	do you play any games with her  like stick out your tongue 
	Alice  where's your tongue 
	where's   stick it out 
	stick it right out 
	go 
	now  she knows how to say shoes 
	and socks 
	does she know shoes from other things like sneakers and sandals 
	they're all shoes 
	they're all shoes to her 
	she knows socks 
	in the food book  she pointed to  she says juice 
	and then you sort of pointed out the other things that went with the meal 
	things like drinking outof the cup 
	does she know those words  because you named them and she didn't 
	um she doesn't use a bib  so she doesn't know that word at all 
	and we don't say cup  she doesn't use a cup  she uses either a bottle or  well  kind of a glass  but she doesn't use that word  there's something else in there  spoon  she knows  -um 
	and soup 
	does she eat soup with a spoon 
	cereal and soup  yeah 
	do you play kissing games with her 
	we kiss a lot 
	and  we  ask her for kisses a lot  and she kisses her sister a lot  we have some books that you smell  and the smelling and the kissing got mixed up a little bit 
	at one point 
	but  so  the smelling the book  let's see  we had a couple a  of different things  it just  you know  when we saw something cute  or kissable  we just kissed em 
	now  becauseof the puppy  she's into biting  so she's learned a new word from the puppy 
	well  the puppy bites her 
	I tell her to tell me whenever the puppy bites and then we whack the puppy cause  ya can't get that started  I mean  we can't let it continue 
	does she play with the blocks now 
	oh  yeah  we got some cloth covered blocks like this that we really like  alotof times we throw them at eachother 
	big new word is apple  right 
	yes  yeah 
	she always recognizes an apple 
	and she learned to say the word chair you were disappointed that  she didn't say it 
	does she have her own little chair 
	well  she climbs on everybody else's 
	no  she doesn't 
	well  yeah  she has some 
	she has a set of chairs  but it's really Lauren  Lauren's set 
	is that a recent word 
	yeah  I was surprised 
	about a week and a half ago  she started saying chair  and I thought  that was not one of Laurent's early words  but she could say it  so 
	and she knows the word for key 
	yeah  
	and I don't know where that came from 
	does she play with yours 
	well  occasionally 
	about a couple of weeks ago  she had my keys  where's Groucho 
	she can say Groucho and Chico 
	we've got these two cats that live in our house  and she says Groucho and Chico 
	well  a lit  occasionally  she does  she'll reach for them when I'm going in the house  and she'll say key 
	that's when I noticed that she could say it 
	and so I give them to her if she can say it 
	she can have it 
	she had trouble with the word ball 
	well  she  she says that a lot 
	is it perhaps because other words are now sounding like that 
	 and you can't figure out what word she means 
	yeah 
	she useta say ball 
	well  she calls balloons balls 
	and when she saw that  she said ball right away 
	but she said it very clearly  the way she useta say it 
	she's got some long sentences now 
	she has mommy see  and  ofcourse allgone  but that's not  mommy bye  you know  she wants to know  she wakes up  she wants to know where everybody is 
	daddy bye  is daddy gone 
	or sister 
	and she says something else  that I thought is a really long sentence 
	it has about  three words in it
