	the blocks 
	yeah 
	well  because that really got her  she was the most enthusiastic playing with that 
	does she have any at home 
	not like this 
	she has got  -um 
	 actually  I was gonna ask you where you got them  she has got bigger and smaller ones  she has got small wooden ones and great big cardboard ones 
	um but these are more fun to knock down 
	-um hum 
	do you have any routines you play a lot with her 
	she seems to play alotof hiding routines  
	yeah  on the changing table  I do put a diaper over her face and peek a boo with her 
	do you do it with blocks also 
	I have never done it with blocks before 
	I have never really been  right in front of her and had blocks 
	usually  you know  if we are in this situation we are eating  And there is no fooling around 
	um when you took the doll and the dog with her  you tried to get her to do things you do at home 
	yeah  like combing the dog and stuff 
	yeah  does she do things like that 
	yeah 
	we have got a dog with a brush and  yeah 
	and she combs her own hair 
	Loren has a couple of brushes and  yeah 
	she has  she has combed our dog before 
	oh  I mean watched me and then you know had it in her hand but sh  you know 
	she has also got some telephone routines 
	oh yeah 
	she has got a telephone 
	yeah and -uh  ours has a dial and I make it ring and she picks it up and says 
	 Hello  laugh 
	and we usually pretend it is Daddy 
	he calls sometimes at home 
	we call him 
	yeah  You want  this 
	you call her attention to things like 
	 look at the boy  look at the girl 
	Do you think she knows the difference when you say words like that 
	no  um That picture  no no she might relate better to baby 
	alotof times I call things  baby  or  um We have a Richard Scarry book that has a baby bunny  we just call him the baby 
	we call him baby bunny  mommy bunny  sometimes too  but  I forgot where I saw the girl 
	no  and I do not think th  -uh these would probably be better just baby 
	but um since these were side by side  did not hurt to differentiate  I guess  now  a little bit 
	what are you doing  funny voice 
	she likes to put things  the putting in and taking out  we have some stacking barrels  and she loves the  you know  putting things  Well  she will take all the barrels out  and keep the biggest one and fill it up with other things and buckets and with her small wooden blocks 
	she likes to put them  away 
	her books right now 
	um I do not know why she did not really respond to  t uh most of the pictures are bigger  and uh and things that she can relate to better than chairs and cops  You know  more dogs and cats  We have got a while book of dogs and cats  the ducks are good  the balloons We have one with a birthday cake and these flowers   um she does not really wh  I do not think can really relate to that very well 
	or just the plain blocks like that  but it's characters doing something  maybe  but  um Jim said she said book	she is really into books 
	she will bring books wherever you are in the house 
	she will go into her room and bring books out and she backs up to you and sits down on your lap and wants them read to her  wants you to look at them with her 
	I realize that f  the whole first half I was really directing her a lot and talking  and assoonas I shut up  she began to talk 
	I think that is  that happens a lot at home  too 
	I did not think she was saying very much  but  laugh
