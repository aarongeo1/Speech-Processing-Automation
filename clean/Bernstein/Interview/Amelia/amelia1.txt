	no 
	I don't 
	no  Yeah  well  it's  there is a difference in  in books and stuff  with boys and girls and I  I just usually make the distinction  between a boy and a girl 
	yeah  I like to do that  I don't  I don't think she knows any difference  I mean  they don't look any different to her  I don't think  laughs Yeah  -uh  well  not  many of these  These  pretty new ones to her  but  with the things that she has at home  she knows  most of the different animals 
	she knows bird  she knows  a rooster  she knows a cow  a horse  a dog  a cat  An' she know pigs  laughs Yeah  those were new 
	she's never seen butterflies either  laughs She looks at them a lot 
	she  she really likes books 
	she  what she does mostly is look at them 
	and  either you can ask her to show you what the different things are and she'll point them out to you  or what she likes to do 
	probably more often is sit there and  point to the picture 
	and have you tell her what it is 
	yeah  most of the time 
	she usually  she usually looks for what she wants 
	I use them both 
	a lot 
	sometimes I call them bunny rabbits  you know  I just do use them both 
	no 
	I don't think I every really thought about it  laughs 
	yeah  I do  I guess 
	I don't  I never really thought about it much 
	I  I talk to them a lot  I think probably and  I usually try to  I guess try to figure out what they're trying to ask me or  you know 
	um on her self she knows  she knows all the face parts  she knows her hair  her head  her arms  she knows her knees  her legs  her feet  her hands  -um  I don't think she knows her fingers  she knows her toes  She probably  she knows a good many of them 
	yeah  just playing  but she does 
	um she does zippers 
	she likes zippers 
	she's always been kinda fascinated with zippers  She doesn't do anything else 
	she doesn't do snaps or button or anything 
	up and down  which way 
	oh  I think she knows when she is somewhere  if I say to her 
	 do you wanna get down 
	that it means  outof where she is 
	down from where she is  I guess she does know that 
	I think  she does  I don't really think she knows asleep as being asleep  but she associates having your eyes closed with being asleep 
	and  there's  a cat  in here  that was asleep and  she pointed that out 
	and she knows when  yeah when your eyes are open  it means you're awake 
	yeah  um different from these  but she does have some 
	um she stacks them some  but mostly what she does is put them in a bowl  She likes to put them in a bowl 
	and knock them over 
	we'll  um I think dragons are a  pretty distinct thing 
	you know  I mean  it's like saying  it's a horse or a cow  I mean  it's a dragon 
	that's what it was  laughing 
	well  if it's a dragon  it's a dragon  you know  
	I think adults probably associate bad things with dragons  but 
	yeah 
	yeah  I point out alotof things to her  you know  we're usually pretty specific about what things are 
	I've even tried making a distinction between pigeons and other kinds of birds  but  I don't think that's worked out  laughs 
	-um  yeah  yeah  she's  probably not as specific  Well  yeah  she's good at it  I guess  I think she does  yeah  She knows arms  legs  hands  feet  and all the face parts 
	yeah  she does 
	yeah  well  she just  she kinda picks it up and um she makes like she's talking into it 
	The other day  I was on the phone  and she was sitting in the other room  just  jabbering away 
	 like she was talking to somebody on the phone 
	alotof times she um picks up the phone and then yells for me  and passes me the phone like it's for me 
	yeah  yeah  she really likes playing peekaboo 
	she likes putting things over her face  and disappearing laughs And coming back 
	are you brushing my hair 
	are you brushing my hair 
	um No 
	I  I think they probably understand  maybe the same amount  maybe a few  different things  but  I think they're  pretty much the same  as far as understanding goes  No  I don't  I don't think so  I think they  probably react diff  a little differently  um I  I don't know but  I  I know that  I just seem to have different com  maybe a little different conversations with Amelia  she  she's a little more vocal than is  right now 
	you know she kinda sits there like she's talking to you sometimes  you know  comes over and tells you a story 
	doesn't really  do that 
	she does once in a while  but not like Amelia does 
	no  I've been reading to them a little bit but they don't  pay any attention  they just wanna point out the pictures  laughs Yeah  this one  laughs 
	that's  that's about all she does 
	she  she does that and she points  or she brings me somewhere  if she wants something 
	um otherwise  she doesn't  I don't think  have any specific sounds for specific things  that I've noticed  anyway  I haven't picked any up 
	yeah  the same way
