	are there some of these books that are better for her stage than others 
	are there words in some of these books that are more familiar than some of the others 
	well  she knows baby  and flower 
	and  um ducks 
	and birds 
	and she's easy to pick  she can pick those out pretty easily 
	she was also looking at the truck and dog and screws and sneakers and shoes and boats 
	house and owl  does she understand any of these words 
	yes  probably everything but the mouse and the owl 
	does she tend to say those words at home 
	she tries to say boat 
	we have a boat 
	so she's familiar with that 
	she  -um  she does say dog  I guess 
	yeah  she does say dog 
	we have a dog  also  so 
	would you like a cat 
	do you know anyone who would like one 
	no 
	my mother's trying to get rid of some cats 
	she's always saying dam	is that sposta be  
	 what's that 
	I don't know 
	well  I thought maybe she was  she was saying 
	 another one 
	because I was saying that to her 
	you know and I think that's something I probably say to her a lot 
	and she was doing that pointing to the same thing 
	I think she has another expression for what's that that sounds almost like she's saying 
	 what's that 
	yeah  she's always asking what things are 
	you know  in new books  or anything  she always wants  she always points things out and wants to know what they are 
	you indicated that she was going to like one of those books because it had paper pages  is there any significance to that 
	well  they don't have any books with paper pages  and they like to do things like rip up the tv guide 
	and things  they like to rip up things with paper pages 
	has she gotten to the point where she can manipulate 
	she appeared to be having some difficulty with the clothing on the doll  she's interested in trying it  but can she manage any of those skills on her own 
	she can take her clothes off 
	you know she can't put her  anything on 
	but she  she  she does try to put things on 
	she was interested in the sneakers 
	yeah 
	they have new sneakers 
	and she tried to untie 
	yeah  she unties her shoes and takes them off 
	and then she comes running to you and wants them back on again 
	no  she usually doesn't want them back on again  laughing 
	what do you want 
	this 
	she really got into the word flower 
	yeah  she's been saying flower for a long time 
	 what do you want  this 
	it's not a baby  it's a boy 
	looks like a baby to you  I guess 
	another baby 
	she's very interested in putting the dog in and outof the house 
	is she into putting doll furniture into houses  or anything like that 
	no 
	she really wanted to open and shut that door so much 
	does she do that much at home 
	no  she doesn't 
	does she understand the terms house and door 
	well  I don't know 
	she knows what house and door are  at home  but I don't know if  to her  that looks like a house 
	or a door 
	she was pointing to the words on the paper 
	yeah  I usually point out 
	words  numbers  that's probably why she was pointing them out 
	does she understand the word 
	 words 
	no  she doesn't 
	but she does pay selective attention to them 
	I think that she knows that they're different than pictures 
	she was really into the textures in this book here  the way you can feel the face and everything  she doesn't have one of these  does she 
	no 
	but this book rips apart 
	has she got any new routines that she didn't have the last time we talked 
	I don't know 
	I can't think of anything  really 
	today she had many more words  or things that sounded closer to words  than before 
	does she attempt to use them with 
	does she talk to 
	she talks to  but never sounds like she's saying anything  to me  you know  when she tries to say things to me  sometimes they sound like words  but when she tries to say things to  they don't  sound like words 
	they kind of babble back and forth to eachother 
	and at this point  you would say that Amelia has a vocabulary of how many words 
	-um  I don't know 
	maybe six  seven words  one  two  probably has two 
	yeah  says Grover and
