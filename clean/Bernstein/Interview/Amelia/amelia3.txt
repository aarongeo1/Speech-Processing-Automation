	she has words now  doesn't she 
	oh  yeah  she does  laughs 
	she spent alotof time talking about the dog 
	and she especially mentioned the house 
	she has the word house  right 
	does she know it for real houses and play houses  does she use it consistently 
	well  she knows real houses  she doesn't  really have anything that are play houses 
	well  well Kristin does  Kristin has a doll house that she knows 
	and she says what  
	 hau	oh  I don't know it  laughs 
	and she knows the door and everything 
	she wanted something to get out  or something and she said 
	 take it out 
	or 
	 it out 
	or something 
	she says  she says alotof things like that that sound  like  she's saying sentences without them being words 
	you know  like she says something like 
	 I wanna walk 
	and the only thing you can really understand is the walk  part 
	she wouldn't play with the phone 
	no 
	well  laughing there was nobody talking to her 
	that's interesting  because many kids prefer toy phones to real phones  real phones scare them 
	she doesn't have a toy phone anymore 
	she useta  but she doesn't any more 
	and  -um  she's only had contact with a real phone  recently 
	does she talk on it 
	she listens  She doesn't talk much  she listens more 
	that's the dog's 
	it's funny because she said No	is that because there was no one there 
	that disturbs her apparently 
	well it didn't do anything  I guess for her  laughs 
	she's very good at grooming the dog  Does she play at grooming animals 
	-um  no 
	she just  she brushes her own hair  but she doesn't  she doesn't really br  I guess she brushes her doll's hair 
	she's really good at looking for the parts of the animal 
	she was good at identifying the eyes  although she got confused with the mouth 
	the nose  it looked just like the eyes 
	and she knew where to look for the mouth 
	 and was disturbed when it wasn't there 
	and  I think I was really surprised when you said 
	 Where's the tail 
	she went and looked right away 
	we have a dog 
	so  I think that's probably why 
	ya wanna go in there 
	does she play with the dog's tail 
	yes 
	she hangs onto the dog's tail and lets the dog pull her around the room 
	she puts the dog in the house  but you don't have a doghouse for the dog 
	no 
	now  with the dragon  She seemed afraid of the dragon  but then after she saw that it was her own  that she could make it move 
	I think she was afraid of it because it moved 
	-uh huh  but after she put her own hand in it 
	yeah  then it was okay 
	does she have puppets at home 
	um no 
	so it's new for her to put her hand in and make something move 
	um they have had a puppet  I can't  I can't remember  They  they really have gotten outof playing with toys 
	recently  they go outside a lot  they  -um  play with cards  that's their new thing  cards  laughs And they have the  a peg thing  you know  with a hammer  I'm sure you've seen those  and they play with that constantly 
	you know  they like things that do things 
	the book that pleased her the most apparently was  were the two books with just pictures  with one picture on a page 
	does she seem to prefer those kinds of books 
	yeah  that's mostly what she's got at home 
	although she  now likes to look at magazines  She likes to look for  um babies in magazines 
	and kids 
	how did you get that out 
	that's the first time anyone got that out 
	I did it  laughing The first time I could get it out  though 
	of the books  though  does she seem to prefer 
	the books she has are very simple 
	probably because I prefer those kind of books 
	not  you look at books that have a cluttering of things on the pages and  you can't really pick anything out 
	she was good at turning the pages when you asked her to 
	does she do that by herself 
	-um hum 
	so she'll sit there and just flip through 
	yeah 
	she doesn't need help 
	no 
	I marked down here that you were supplying the words for some things  and some things she was naming  for instance  you named the cat  and then later on  she named it for you  can she consistently name a cat 
	no  she's usually very  good about it  I don't know  maybe that didn't look like a cat to her at first 
	she picks out cats very well 
	she didn't name the boy and the girl 
	she pointed to them  but she didn't name them 
	no 
	she calls them kids 
	alotof times 
	do you want this in 
	I just had it in  and there you wanted it out 
	she did notice the dogs  that she had a word for 
	she calls the dog her name 
	she knows the word chair 
	a couple of kids her age have recently been fixated by chairs  does she enjoy climbing in and outof chairs 
	yes  she does 
	does she have her own 
	no just her  highchair 
	www 
	you don't want this 
	alright  why don't you go put it away 
	can you go do that for me 
	she obviously doesn't like help getting in and outof 
	no 
	now  with the crayons  she didn't say crayons  but she knew what you did with them 
	does she play with them 
	yeah 
	she does 
	she scribbles with them 
	and she knows that they're for writing  do you think that was what she was saying 
	yeah  she was saying write	with alotof things  you were giving functions  sothat with the chair and the cup  it was to sit in  and to drink milk  Does she understand those functions  I mean does she  Are you trying to add words 
	no  I think she understands 
	and she uses a cup  so she knows what it's for 
	yeah  she knows 
	I think she understands those 
	just pull it out  it'll come out 
	another word that she had  and I wonder if it was from the summer  was hole	she likes holes 
	now  with the blocks 
	she useta just carry them around in a bowl  what does she do now 
	oh  yeah  she likes to stack them  she likes to knock them over 
	so she's not just carrying them from place to place 
	no 
	she's trying to build with them 
	-um hum 
	the last thing 
	she was noticing the cow and the bird  and then she had trouble with the whale  she thought it was a bird 
	and again  you said the bird is to fly 
	she knows birds fly 
	she says that a lot 
	birds fly 
	because we feed the birds and then she watches them fly away 
	you're gonna put the brush in there
