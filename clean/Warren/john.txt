	-uh huh  makes like a crossword puzzle 
	four 
	this is a different kind of crossword puzzle 
	so where would it go 
	well  we hafta see how many words have four spaces in them and I think I only see one place 
	where 
	can you find it  look around and see  it's going down 
	here 
	no  see  that's a whole word right there that'd be too big 
	whatabout right there 
	that wouldn't hook up with another word 
	yeah  but it will when we get them all filled in  see  they're going to all go together 
	see  in this kind of crossword puzzle they don't give you the clues they just give you the words  but you hafta figure out where they go 
	okay well  you can check that one off 
	do you mean like this 
	right  just so you know you did it okay  now pick another word that see  they've got them separated into how many letters are in the word 
	storm 
	okay  now we're going to hafta look around for a	five letters  I think I see one 
	that's right 
	right here 
	and what does it end in 
	m	okay that must be it okay 
	there's storm 
	okay there's one more with five letters 
	what does it say 
	that's teens 
	what does teens mean 
	that would be like if you're age thirteen to nineteen  you would be in your teens 
	a teenager 
	well  why does it have that 
	I don't know why that's in there 
	it looks like a kind of strange word for superheroes  doesn't it 
	well  maybe some of them are in their teens 
	maybe so  but if you look around  there will be one more word with five letters in it 
	one more letter 
	one more word a five letter word  can you find where that is 
	here 
	-uh huh 
	teens 
	okay  well  all those four have seven letters  sothat might be a little harder  because you're going to hafta figure out the right place to put it 
	one  two  three  four  five  six  seven 
	okay  that's seven letters so that'll be a hint 
	would that be the bottom one 
	it could be either that one or that one  couldn't it 
	well  let's see where the other seven letter ones are 
	well  it's going to be hard I tell you what  let's figure out what word this is 
	maybe this one 
	it will give you a hint  find a word down there that starts with a c	one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  it has eight letters 
	there's only one word with eight letters  isn't there 
	how do you spell that 
	that's Colossus 
	is that a person in superheroes 
	I don't know 
	you never heard of that one 
	why won't you write it down 
	okay  I'll write that one down 
	see  then  this is going to give you a hint -um  the other words that go across this way 
	one  two  three  four  five  six  seven 
	okay  so one is here  seven letter words that will go in there 
	which one would that be 
	-um 
	the fourth letter hasta be the f	six 
	okay  what word is this 
	I can't read it 
	Banshee  is that in superheroes 
	I don't know about that
