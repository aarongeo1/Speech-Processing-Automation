	 he seems to know when someone is near 
	duh  the rabbits are near 
	the rabbits are near  and he can smell them 
	 wind brings your nose signals you cannot hear or see or feel 
	this dog can smell these rabbits because their smell is going 
	up to his nose  by the wind 
	yeah  yeah  and dey're  they're   dey  they are watching

	that way you can tell which direction the wind is coming from  north  west  south  or east 
	 wind makes sailboats go  the sail catches the wind 
	 it pushes the boat through the water  if the wind does not blow hard enough  or if it stops  the boat will stop  sometimes wind is too strong for small boats to go out in the water  then men put up a red flag and the small boats must stay tied up to a dock in a safe harbor 
	and  why he's sitting on dat  that log and watching duh  the da dat  that 
	because it's too windy out and his boat can't go out  see  he only has a little boat and when it's too  when the wind is too strong  sometimes it could make  it could blow away little boats  it just  you know  it could blow them right down  it's very dangerous

	oh  and why  why duh  the boat is tied to here 
	why is it tied to there 
	yeah 
	well  because  so it won't blow away  if you don't tie up a boat  then it can just drift away into the water  just like this 
	oh  dey  they wanna have deir  their own so dey  they tie it to here 
	yeah  that's their own boat and they wanna keep it
