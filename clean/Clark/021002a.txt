	you can pull dat  that   dat  that   dat  that bicycle xxx 
	dis  this goes like dat  that and that goes like that 
	see 
	no 
	how does it work 
	you mean when you  oh you  you can pull this with this 
	no  no  you tie a knot on there and you leave that string down on the ground and you put this wagon here 
	oh  so the motorcycle can tow the car 
	yeah 
	oh 
	yeah 
	you can take duh  the motorcycle to duh  the car  okay 
	no  I want xxx 
	well  you might hafta detach it from the  -um  little  ah  pedal here
