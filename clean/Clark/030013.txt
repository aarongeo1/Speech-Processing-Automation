	if there's no seatbelts  then we can go along in our car 
	for sure 
	and he can be near the truck 
	why do we hafta go along in our car 
	because Shem and Kevin will not be able to ride in the truck if there's no seatbelts 
	you need some seatbelts 
	but I don't wanna do  I don't wanna go in our  my car
