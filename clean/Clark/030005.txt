	 you're right 
	 it is a real rocket 
	 it's coming towards us 
	 the rocket lands close beside them with a noise 
	 what's going on 
	 suddenly a strong wind picks the elephants up like feathers and sucks them right into the cabin of the rocket 
	 the door closes before they have time to realize what is happening to them 
	 the rocket carries them off into space 
	what is this doing 
	dat's  that's duh  the candied one 
	yeah 
	this thing is a  -um machine in the middle of the rocket  and it hands them little biscuits and candy  for them to eat

	 what an adventure 
	 moans Celeste 
	 the trip is long 
	oh  what is it doing here

	do you know what 
	what 
	dey  they have trunks 
	yeah  they look just like elephants 
	they look like shrunken up little elephants 
	 Babar calls to Celeste  come and see the inhabitants of this soft planet

	right  long trunks and long ears  just like elephants 
	yeah 
	 the strange fellows invite Babar and Celeste to get in nextto them 
	 then they take them to some platforms where they moor their craft 
	 next  some flying eggs float down from the sky and the curly eared elephants seat themselves on small stools hung beneath 
	 quick  said Babar  let's follow them 
	 these flying eggs rise high in the sky 
	 a city appears  hanging in the air from enormous balloons 
	 lightly and silently it floats above the soft planet 
	 this planet is amazing  isn't it  Zephyr 
	oh  what is this  Shem 
	dat's  that's a hotel  where you do fings  things and  and go up duh  the ladders and den slide down 
	you go up the ladders and you slide down 
	yeah 
	why 
	because duh  duh  the ladders you  go down and den you go across dere  there and in nere  there and den you go up dere  there and den you slide down 
	mm 
	but what are these little eggs doing 
	dey  they floating to do balloons 
	floating to do balloon 
	and  and  and Arfur goes dere  there  to  a  one of duh  the balloons and pop dem  them 
	oh  I hope he doesn't pop them 
	yeah  he did 
	he's gonna do it 
	oh  dear 
	 they land gently on a terrace 
	 the natives rush up to look at them 
	 one  wearing a pointed hat  approaches Babar and makes an interminably long speech  while another  wearing a hat shaped like a mushroom  smiles nearby 
	 ofcourse  Babar doesn't understand a word  but he guesses that Mister Pointed Hat is inviting him to visit the town 
	see  they follow them and slide down the ladders and go into different places in the town 
	and dey  they come out duh  the top of dis  this ladder dere  there 
	yeah 
	yeah 
	they come outof this little egg thing 
	 in the house belonging to Pointed Hat and Blue Mushroom there is a swimmingpool in the livingroom 
	 truly  says Arthur  these elephants with  curly ears know how to live 
	 Flora has no desire to plunge into the pool 
	 she has found a friend  a little dog with blue spots 
	where's that little dog  Shem 
	does that look like a regular dog 
	yeah 
	no  it doesn't 
	look  what are those funny things on its head

	but isn't that kind of a funny looking jumping place 
	yeah 
	and dey  they sitting on nere  there unti un  to wait duh  dose  those other elephants to get out a  and den dey  they can go in 
	oh  yeah 
	 in the evening they are shown to their bedrooms 
	 these are little wall niches 
	see  they fit into the wall 
	 Babar and Celeste are too big to fit into them  so Blue Mushroom orders the pool emptied and filled with pillows 
	mm  doesn't that look comfortable 
	yeah 
	 every morning  escorted by the little dog  they all go to the breakfast fountain with Pointed Hat and Blue Mushroom 
	 this is an automatic fountain which serves cakes and soft drinks 
	Babar	he trying to get a a  he trying to get a a -um a shoe  but h  but he can't h duh  the duh  the -um -um shoes fit him
