** Cleaning Step **
Removing Headers and Extraneous Information: Cleaning the data by removing headers and
extraneous information is crucial for the transformation task because these parts of the
text do not contain phonetic information relevant to the pronunciation transformation. 
Keeping them would introduce noise into the transformation process.

Handling '*' Lines: handling lines starting with '*' up to ':' is necessary because 
these lines typically contain annotations, speaker names, or other non-phonetic 
information. Such lines/parts of lines are irrelevant to the transformation task, and 
their removal helps simplify the data.

Removing Content Between "NAK" Markers: Content between "NAK" markers, including "NAK" 
itself, is removed because it does not provide phonetic information. It is specific to
the original data format and is not relevant to the transformation.

Removing Lines with Only '0' in Conversation: Lines with only '0' in conversation are 
removed because they do not contain phonetic content and are unlikely to contribute to
the transformation task. This step helps in cleaning out irrelevant data.

Removing Special Characters: Removing special characters that are not part of the
ArpaBET phoneme set ensures that the text is prepared for accurate phonetic
transformation. It prevents interference from characters that do not have 
a phonetic counterpart in the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary.

Removing Numbers: Removing numbers from the text is justified because the 
transformation task focuses on mapping words to their phonetic representations. 
Numbers are not part of the ArpaBET phoneme set and are typically not relevant 
for pronunciation transformation.

Contractions: Contractions such as can't were not modified to their full forms (ex: cannot)
because such an action would alter the underlying pronunciation of the word and therefore would
not be suitable for the downstream task.

** Transformation Step **
Not in dictionary - While searching in the dictionary, if the word is not found in the 
    dict then it will not have a phonetic sound associated with it, therefore the word will 
    be removed from the transformed data

Multiple pronunciation - For words that map to multiple pronunciations, the first
    phonetic translation of the word is used since it is the most popular pronunciation.
    This implementation is also computationally tractable.

Lexical stress markers -  lexical stress markers (such as AA1) were left in the final 
    output because they are important for understanding the pronunciation of the word
